                The original OffroadPakistan.com was founded a very long time ago, documenting (some of) the many adventures of the 4x4 Offroaders Club Karachi as they explored Pakistan's most remote and challenging terrains.
            </p>

            <p>
                Club members ventured forth where few had gone before - across the Thar Desert, through the northern valleys of
                Gilgit-Baltistan, up to K2 Base Camp, and into the cultural
                heartlands of Chitral and the Kalash valleys. Each expedition
                was meticulously documented with photographs and detailed trip
                reports.

                The club members were pioneers of Pakistani adventure travel,
                exploring regions that were largely undocumented in the early
                70's to the 2000's.
