Practically all our 4×4’s run on diesel fuel, which is becoming prohibitively expensive, so it’s surprising that no one in Pakistan has looked into vegetable oil yet. The [New York Times reports](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/automobiles/23AUTO.html?ei=5088&en=fbb6ea9f58b75781&ex=1311307200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=all):

According to test results I’ve seen, vegetable oil burns somewhat cleaner in most categories than diesel fuel, and emits absolutely no sulfur.

Various reports on the internet confirm that converting over to vegetable oil doesn’t harm the engine:

> A common concern about converting a car for vegetable oil is that it could harm the engine. But some people who have done conversions say they’ve seen no damage, even after many miles.
