Two new generation D-4D common rail direct injection diesel engines have been introduced with the new Hilux. Since the new Hilux is widely available in Pakistan, it is to be hoped that one fine day these engines will show up in Shershah.

Capacities are 2.5-litres and 3.0-litres. The 2KD-FTV unit is a 2.5-litre four cylinder turbocharged engine with 16-valve DOHC cylinder head. This engine is offered in normal and high-spec versions depending on model derivative. In both instances the maximum power is 75kW at 3600rpm. Maximum torque for the normal specification engine is 200Nm available from 1400rpm through to 3400rpm. The high spec version of this engine produces 260Nm of torque between 1600rpm and 2400rpm.

The 1KD-FTV engine is a 3.0-litre four cylinder turbocharged and inter-cooled engine, also with a 16-valve DOHC configuration. Maximum power is 120kW at 3400rpm and peak torque of 343Nm is delivered between 1400rpm and 3200rpm. The electronically controlled common rail type fuel injection system used on these engines provides exceptional fuel management with a microcomputer controlling the injection pressure, injection timing and the volume of the fuel charge.

#### D-4D direct-injection common rail diesel engine

This modern technology makes use of a high-pressure pump, a common rail, and computer-controlled injectors to deliver exactly the right amount of fuel to each cylinder, at precisely the right timing. It is this exact timing and fuel measurement that leads to better combustion, cleaner burning and lower emissions of harmful substances such as soot (meeting European Step III exhaust gas regulations). And it is common rail injection that ensures D-4D engines deliver the optimum in power and torque throughout the range of rpm, for better driving performance and comfort.

Fuel in the D-4D is pressurised to an extremely high 135mpa within the “common rail” that feeds all four cylinders (older diesel engines have a separate pipe leading from the pump to each cylinder). The high pressure injection creates better fuel atomisation for complete burning and increased power output. And because there is less fuel wasted though inefficient combustion, the D-4D delivers better fuel economy too.

In addition the computer control unit injects a small amount of fuel into the cylinder just before the main fuel load ignites. This “pilot burn” lowers the explosive force of the main combustion process and goes a long way to reduce the noise and vibration formerly associated with diesel engines. This all goes to make it one of the silkiest diesels ever built.

The all-new D-4D diesel engine can now be test driven on the following cars: Yaris, Yaris Verso, Corolla, Corolla Verso, Land Cruiser 90, Hilux.
