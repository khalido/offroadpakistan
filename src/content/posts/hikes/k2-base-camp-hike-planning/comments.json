Pictures with comments are also amazing.</p>\n\n\t<p>I did hiking in these areas many years back and then I started going to Northern areas by motor bike while camping on the way. At that time I hardly find and any Pakistani explorers in the higher north though I always wondered why v ourselves dont explore our country while others do with passion. Its been a while since I last visited mountains in Pak. I would love to go back there in my next trip to Pakistan.</p>\n\n\n ",

I m also very interested like other friends but the main problem is that there is a little interest in hiking and tracking. I always try to my best to find a friend who walk with me but it seems that 99.9% of our peoples likes luxurious life but i like those who want to cross the world on foot not those who can&#8217;t walk a step without vehicle. Thanx again for very nice &#038; important tips, tricks and sharing the views.</p>\n\n\n ",
