Its wheelbase and ground clearence is best suited for such like terrain. If you would have used this vehicle, you journey would have been much more comfortable. I have the vast experience of serving and doing patrolling in this area by driving more than 60,000 kms over a period of more than a year, and if i would be of any assistance do not hesitate to contact me. my e-mail is syedbaleegh@yahoo.com, with sincere regards</p>\n\n\t<p>Major Baleegh Ur Rehman</p>\n\n\n",
