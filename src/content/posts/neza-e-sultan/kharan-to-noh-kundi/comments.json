      "content": "\t<p>Dear Sir ,</p>\n\n\t<p>Between  August 1960 &#038; December 1962 ,I drove my Riley 9hp car made in 1933 ,from England to Australia &#038; back .I left England with &#163;130 &#038; otherwise worked my way as an odd job man /mechanic .The drive involved crossing quite a lot of desert in the Middle &#038; Far East ,plus another dose crossing from  Fremantle to Sydney in Australia (The Nullarbor) . The worst desert conditions were experienced in Iran &#038; Balochistan . I could get no maps of the area probably because there were no roads as we know them in Europe ! A few miles of road had been built around Teheran but otherwise very corrugated tracks were the only way to travel from Ankara to the Pakistan border .I am just finishing my book on the journey after all this time &#038; remember a place called Nok Kundi (?) at the border of Iran &#038; Pakistan .Is this still a border crossing ? I remember the area well for the blinding sand storms &#038; no shortage of parking facilities ! From Teheran  to the Pakistan border  I saw about half a dozen trucks but no cars . The road down to Ceylon was a very narrow  tarmac strip full of potholes but easier on the car than Iran!It was a great  trip using a marvellous little car which went on to cross <span class=\"caps\">USA </span> to Canada .We shipped back from Montreal at Xmas time 1962. It didn&#8217;t cost much ,I arrived back with no cash to show for the trip but a wealth of experiences ,hence the long delayed book !</p>\n\n\t<p>Regards,</p>\n\n\t<p>George Yallop</p>\n\n\t<p>yallop.co. uk</p>\n\n\n ",

      "content": "\t<p>Dear Dr. Ahmad:</p>\n\n\t<p>In 1972-73 I made a road trip in a Toyota Corolla with 2 American guys. I was an exchange student from Kent State U. in Ohio, <span class=\"caps\">USA</span>, (famous for the May 1970 shootings of students by the Ohio National Guard) to Pahlavi University in Shiraz, now Shiraz U., on a road trip during No Ruz break.  On our way between Nok Kundi and Kandahar, a man who was apparently stranded on the road when his car broke down (it was a nice car), flagged us down for a ride. We weren�t sure if this was a set-up, and were afraid to stop for him, but he placed himself in our path in such a way that we would have had to run him over in order to continue on without him!  I don�t remember if the road was asphalt, because all I saw was yellow sand, blown into mini-dunes all around.  This may have been around the area of Quetta.  He took us to a place that looked like an oasis! I thought I was dreaming!  I don&#8217;t know who he was, or where he took us, but he hosted us very kindly.  It may have been a placed called Dera Ghazi Khan.</p>\n\n\t<p>Now, reading your travelogue, I wonder if it was one of the karez supplied plantation areas?</p>\n\n\t<p>At any rate, your travelogue has inspired me to dig out my travel journals and read about my own adventures through the koh y dasht of Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to document it for my nieces, nephews and their children.</p>\n\n\t<p>I�ll never forget my 21st birthday in Kabul, staying in a glassed-in &#8220;room&#8221; on the roof of a hotel there, since no other rooms were available.  We were grateful to have been provided a few cots, rather than try to sleep all 3 of us in the little Corrolla.  We awoke with the sun moving over the mountaintop.  <span class=\"caps\">INCREDIBLE</span> places!  My heart aches for these places, and I was only passing through.  What an amazing part of this earth.   Thank you for the fun and interesting reading material in your travelogue.   Ruth D</p>\n\n\n ",

As kharn always haunts me and keep looking anything related to Kharan,reading your account,enhanced my eagerness to go there.</p>\n\n\t<p>I belong to some stranded branch of Naushirwani tribe.My forefathers</p>\n\n\t<p>came  here in Jhang, Punjab,centuries ago,Allah knows when how and why.So,Khran keeps haunting me where a lot of Naushirwan&#8217;s descendents</p>\n\n\t<p>dwell.</p>\n\n\t<p>I long to go there,to mingle with naushirwani&#8217;s.and to search my lost indedntity.Maybe someone of them or of the area can bridge this gruesome gap of centuries.</p>\n\n\t<p>I know nothing about the journey. Can you please guide me,what is the most convenient route from jhang to Kharan?where to stay?</p>\n\n\t<p>I do not know driving and will have to depend on public transport already available there.Maybe you can name someone who is helpful in my search and stay.I will be very thankful what ever knowledge you can provide.</p>\n\n\t<p>Sadiq</p>\n\n\n ",

      "content": "Terrific post. Judging by the number of Toyota Land Cruiser FZJ79s and Stouts you must have seen plying the roads (as well as the non-roads), I bet your Jeeps must have looked exotic!\n\nI also read your excellent post (elsewhere on the site) about the trip between Mashkel and Plantak, and thence, onwards to Panjgur. If any of you are into a bit of \"rock-climbing\" on four wheels, there's a very challenging route cutting straight between Mashkel and Panjgur, that leads right over the Siahan mountain range. It also reduces the traveling time between Mashkel and Panjgur, by 2-3 hours. Definitely not for the faint of heart, though!\n\nKeep up the good work with the site. Cheers.\n\nFouad.",

      "content": "@ Sadiq Hussain Goher.\n\nI don't know if you're still following this thread (seeing as how it's been a year and a half since your post), but the best way for you to visit Kharan, would be to reach Quetta (by air / road / rail), and take a bus journey to Kharan via Mastung, Panjpai and Nushki. You'll be able to get seats from the bus stand (Adda) at Quetta for Rs. 400-500. Booking a vehicle for yourself, would likely cost you roughly 6-8 times that amount. The Nausherwanis themselves, are a prominent family of the region, and if you're kith and kin you'll be welcomed as an honoured guest. Best bet would be to get in contact with the DC of the district, and ask him to provide you with details of whom you might possibly contact. I'm not much aware of hotels where you might stay, but I'm sure you could manage a decent place to stay for a few days, at no great expense. Whilst there, you might want to take a trip to Galoogah (near Mashkel) which is the traditional burial site of the Nausherwani rulers. It's well worth it, to find out where some of your ancestors may have been entombed. Other regions where the Nausherwanis are present, include Mashkel, Dalbandin, and Nokkundi; which are all within a few hours traveling time from Kharan.\n\nBest of luck with the trip, if you still have your mind set on it.\n\nFouad.",
