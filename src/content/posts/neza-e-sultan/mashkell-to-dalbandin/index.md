Hamid Omar's CherokeeÂ broke down in the Mashkell desert, We later found that the crankshaft position sensor had been struck and broken by a rock kicked up by the wheels. After being towed all the way to Dalbandin, it was put on a truck and sent back to Karachi.

There was a death in the family, so we cut the trip short and decided to head straight back to Karachi, abandoning the original longer route.
