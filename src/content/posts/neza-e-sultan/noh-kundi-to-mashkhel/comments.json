      "content": "\t<p>I remained Wing Commander 84 Wing, Mashkel (Lad Gasht), from Aug 2002 to Sep 2003, once i was in Kharan Rifles. I have had a number of gasht in the area. I have seized around 50 smuggled vehicles alongwith a huge quantity of Iranian petrol and diesel. I have had a number of trips in the Human-e-Mashkel, that dried bed of lake which is in between Mashkel and Nokkundi. Presently i accounts officer in training Centre at Loralai. If you would have the experience of seeing Gluka, the doubled storied Graveyard, it would have been a great experience. The Gluka is 8 kms from Mashkel, and is a worth seeing place. If i would be on any help on any aspect related to Mashkel, i will be more than happy to assist you. Seeing your visit in Mashkel, i just wrote this mail to you. Thanking you</p>\n\n\t<p>Major Baleegh Ur Rehman 19th Jan 2004.</p>\n\n\n ",

Now i remembered everything. I knew your strength was 27. You then went to Nokkundi where Major Mukhtar has looked after you. Well you people are really fantastic. How one can be your member to explore Pakistan. Regards</p>\n\n\t<p>Major Baleegh Ur Rehman 19th Jan 2003</p>\n\n\n ",
