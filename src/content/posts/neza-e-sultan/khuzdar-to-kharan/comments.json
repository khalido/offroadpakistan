I was just doing a research on Kharan which is my birht place to see if there is anything about that tiny part of the world on this world wide web thingy.  I was so surprised to see so much.  I last visited Kharan last year after 14 years it was a very good adventure for me,  I will never forget the tall mountains the dryness the people and so much more.  I am trying to save up a little to go back soon.  its not only my birth place but i have some property and a lot of raletives to visit I make a lot of phone call there because i am so for away in Canada toronto and i miss Kharan.</p>\n\n\n",
