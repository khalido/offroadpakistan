[Outside Magazine’s 25 Best Adventure Books of the Last 100 Years](http://outside.away.com/outside/features/200301/200301_adventure_canon_1.html)

bq.. The following list is devoted to books that offer the truest inspiration, the deepest reflection, the strongest provocation. These are books that seize imaginations and rattle sedentary lives.

…This time around, we were determined to drill to the core. To compile the distilled contents of a tool kit for adventure literacy. The writing, we decided, must be urgent and contemporary in spirit, so we narrowed our sights to the last 100 years or so. No fiction. No collections and no geopolitical reportage. (Otherwise, how could we pass up Cahill and Kapuscinski?) Nothing classic for the sake of self-importance�we wanted two-fisted, readable works defined by an insatiable appetite for the world at its wildest. Books that do what the indomitable boxer Joe Frazier had in mind when he said, “I don’t want to knock my opponent out. I want to hit him, step away, and watch him hurt. I want his heart.”

These books stole ours.

A good place to start building a travel library.
