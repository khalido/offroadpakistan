People looking to get sleeping bags and camping equipment in Karachi can now get Coleman Brand at MAKRO on very reasonable prices. Its located in SITE after you cross the Railway bridge on the way to Orangi from SITE DC office—also known as Habib Bank Chowrangi.

Thanks to Pervez Sadiq for the above info.

The other source of good sleeping bags are the ones available Hajji Camp – they’re quite good and are what practically all of us use.
