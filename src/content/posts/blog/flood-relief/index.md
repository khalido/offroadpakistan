The earthquake’s that have hit Pakistan in 2005 and 2008 were regarded as the worst tragedy for the nation. Few have realized that the recent floods have in fact caused more damage then those earthquakes did. As per latest reports official figures stand at **1600 dead** and **20 million left homeless**.

The Monsoon rains began three weeks ago and have washed away roads, bridges and communications lines, hampering rescue efforts by aid organizations and the government. The downpours have grounded many aircraft trying to rescue people and ferry aid.

Currently 30,000 Pakistan Army troops are busy in rescue and relief efforts. Where as the Earthquake of 2005 and 2008 and the IDP crisis were devastating, unlike the Flooding they were contained within a geographic area. Flooding has been reported from [Kyhber-Pakthunkwa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa) all they way down to Southern [Punjab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_(Pakistani_province)) and [Sindh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh). There is only so much the government and the armed forces can do in the face of such a massive disaster and so we as citizens have undertaken the mantle of trying to add our little drop to the ocean.

To that end, we have decided to take up relief efforts to the areas of Sindh in an attempt to help bring relief to the suffering. The idea is initially to partner with a team of who is willing to take the relief goods up. We hope to launch such an intiative with **Motorsports Club of Pakistan** and our very own [**OffroadPakistan**](http://offroadpakistan.com) group to some part of Sindh and personally deliver the goods there. To help our international donors we have partnered with [SA Relief](http://sarelif.com) operating under the aiegus of [**Paksef**](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/paksef) a US Tax-deductible 501©(3) NGO registered in California to enable our US based well wishers to contribute to the relief via Chipin and Paypal.

The online collection is slated to run through out Ramazan to tap into the generous Zakat giving ability of Muslims around the world, ideally this would mean two missions, one from the cash funds collected personally in Karachi while the second mission will utilize the generous contribution from online donations. It is my personal promise that all funds collected will be disbursed off in a total transparent manner as possible, all recipts and travel expenditures will be posted online for the world to see. Like the IDP Relief effort we did in 2009 [**here**](http://teeth.com.pk/blog/2009/05/15/collection-drive-for-idp-relief-team-to-swat), [**here**](http://teeth.com.pk/blog/2009/05/31/idp-relief-drive-karachi-mardan-report).

Donations can be made directly into **MOTORSPORTS CLUB PAKISTAN** account at Samba Bank Ltd. in Karachi. A/C#06500379349 or even online on the widget provided above which is processed via Paypal and these online contributions are being collected by **PAKISTAN SCIENCE & ENGINEERING FOUNDATION** a 501©(3) registered California based not-for-profit organization, EIN# 20-2950808.

The [BBC reports](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10981230):

bq.. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has described as “heart-wrenching” the destruction he witnessed on a visit to flood-devastated Pakistan.

Mr Ban said the scale of the disaster was greater than anything he had seen before.
