If we donate, and we stipulate that it is zakat, will all of the money go for that?  I know that that the organization needs money to function, and normally I wouldnâ€™t mind that, but for the zakat can we stipulate that all the money goes for feeding the flood victims?</p>\n\n\t<p>Thanks</p>\n\n\n",
