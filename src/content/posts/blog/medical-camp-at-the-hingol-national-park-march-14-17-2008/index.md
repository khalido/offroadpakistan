Our group has been approached by the Management of Hingol National Park to help them in organizing a free medical camp at Jhal Jhau for the villagers living along the Hingol River in the Northern Part of the Park. We are going for 4 days to Hingol, Baluchistan, March 14-17, 2008 and setting up a medical camp. Read on for the details.

* **Day 1:** Getting there, setting up camp (min. 6 hours road drive, than 13km semi-offroad to camp)

* **Day 2:** Medical Camp, we stay overnight same place (no driving, the more adventurous can go hiking)

If all goes well, the camp should be over in about 5 hours, expecting about 150-200 patients, with 4 doctors looking at them.

* **Day 3:** Wind up, move onwards – offroading! Camp will change. (unknown hours, all offroad)

* **Day 4:** Back to the city (9-10 hours total driving time from camp to city).

Taimur Mirza and Hamid Omar are going to Uthal this Sunday to meet with the Park authorities to finalize the medical camp logistics. At the present time a total of 6 doctors have volunteered their time and expertise, and two pharm companies are donating medicines, and we are collecting donations from other people (especially Salim Khan!). Please contact us for further details, using the contact form.

We will be camping all three nights, and as always, everyone needs to bring everything which they possibly might need, and for good measure a few things which they might impossibly need.
