Having travelled all over Pakistan, I have finally come to the conclusion that Balochistan is one of the least explored and most fascinating place on the blue planet.

An archaeologists paradise, a geologists dream come true, Off-roaders, camping enthusiasts, trekkers, star gazers, nature buffs, desert roamers, history diggers, miners, prospectors, in short every one who is associated with or loves the out doors would find this land pulling like a magnet if once visited.

Mansur the Doc., Homer the industrialist-cum-inventor, Kaleem Omar the journlist, Khan Sahib the old guard, Wazir Ahmad the lawyer, Ismail Sahib the paratha master, and off course me the organiser; but not forgetting the number of “boys” ever ready to lend a helping hand in setting up camp, getting firewood, washing dishes, disposing off garbage, and keen audience to the numerous tales around the campfire, are a group always cribbing about each other, yet always ready and waiting for another “Jeep trip”.

How long will we be able to see the “yesterday” we now observe, as today’s technology is gradually creeping forward? Maybe you?ll find a McDonalds at Nani Mandar tomorrow, and then where will the charm be?
