The object of the “Dureji Expedition” is to drive through various within the jurisdiction of Dureji Tehsil. The route consists mainly of Shingle tracks which are primarily used by camels and infrequently by vehicles, thereby providing ample opportunity for drivers to test their skill. The Expedition also aims at traveling in a group to ensure that problems faced by any particular member with respect to vehicle breakdown, etc., can be jointly dealt with and resolved, removing the fear of being stuck in some remote valley with no help. Rest assured, we will all be there.

The Expedition is scheduled to depart from Karachi on the 17th of November, 2006 from Defence Phase V and shall consist of 3 traveling days and 2 night stays. All participants will have to bring their own food and water and other necessities, whereas excellent camping ground with electricity and toilets and kitchen, etc., will be available at the camp site. The area we shall be driving through is located just North – North East of the Hub Dam which is visible on Google Earth next to Karachi.

We already have over fifteen 4×4 Jeep owners enlisted for the Expedition including a few families.
