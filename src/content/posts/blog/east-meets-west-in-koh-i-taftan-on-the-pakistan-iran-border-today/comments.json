      "content": "<p>I planned a cycle trip from London to Bangladesh (DHaka) via all of Europe and eventually Iran and Pakistan on to India and BAngladesh. I was advised that the border between Iran and Pakistan is very dangerous and different problems led to my cancellation of this trip. I also wanted to fundraise on the way. I wish these ‘jeep’ lovers all the best and wish I could also follow in their footsteps one day.</p>\n\n\n",
