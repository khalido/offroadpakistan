I can guarantee that every jeep veteran has learned from getting stuck.  Fahad….. good for you. You?re doing exactly what a jeep is supposed to be doing. Axle deep in mud.</p>\n\n\t<p>p.s. please check to make sure that your mud encounter did not introduce water/mud, into the axles. Usually the axle breathers in Pakistan are not in the best of shape and can lead to water going into the axels.</p>\n\n\n",
