I can relate to all this because just yesterday (30 Jan, 2011) I returned from this trip. Due to the allergy of my friend from so much dust, we both stayed behind otherwise we would also have gone to Pol Dat as well. But I still managed to get breathtaking photographs because this whole place is so wonderful.</p>\n\n\n",
