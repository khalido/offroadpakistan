      "content": "<p>If one looks at the front view and compares it to the rear view, you see a small detail error. On the front view it looks like the second part of the door opens to the rear like a double cab. Note similar hinges to front door hinges on rear panel. On rear view showing spare wheel the panel seems to be slightly extended. Which would be the correct form? Whatever the errors the Jeep is awesome and brings back memories of the 1970’s Gladiators which were a favorite of mine.</p>\n\n\n",
