> Ah, yes, what a Jeep should be. Iï¿½m hoping that we are not only seeing what the next generation Wrangler will look like, but a true Scrambler off-shoot. Jeep hasnï¿½t had a real pickup truck in a while and I think itï¿½s time they got back into the game. Drop the goofy, rear view blocking spare tire, and we have a production vehicle here.
