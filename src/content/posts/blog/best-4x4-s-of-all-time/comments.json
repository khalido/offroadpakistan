      "content": "<p>I’m with ya on the flat fender, both willys and ford were awsome. I also think that the 66-77 Ford Bronco is the altime best 4×4 and also easiest to modify. I have a lot of friends that wheel J**ps but they all deep down wish that it came with a Dana 44 front axle 9” rear axle and a V-8 stock.</p>\n\n\n",
