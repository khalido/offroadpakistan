The Second Dureji Expedition is scheduled for the 27th – 29th of January 2007. It will be a 2 night / 3 day trip with departure at 8 a.m. on Saturday, the 27th of January 2007, travelling staight to the base of Andahar Mountain (height – 4,000 ft) and setting up camp there for both nights. The second day we’ll 4wheel up the mountain, have lunch there, then return back to camp for the night. Return scheduled for the Monday, Jan 29th.

This trip offers some great off roading opportunities along with some dramatic scenery. Keeping in view the costs associated with organizing the entire trip which includes food, cooks, helpers, the camp staff, etc….there is a cost per vehicle should you wish to participate. The cost ranges between Rs. 5,000/- to Rs. 10,000/- per vehicle (vehicle = two persons), depending upon the number of participants.

If you wish to participate, please [email us](http://offroadpakistan.com/contact/) along with details regarding the number of vehicles in your group, number of people intending to go on the trip and the type of vehicle that you shall be driving along with your contact details. The last date to submit your details is the 20th of January, 2007. Submitting a request does not guarantee entry as many things have to be taken into consideration, especially the fact that the vehicle you intend to drive on the trip is road worthy and not liable to break down during the trip as there will be no mechanical help available for miles.

Hope to see you all there. You can see pictures of the last trip to the area [here](./index.html).

Food, security, logistics, guides etc are arranged for. Besides that, here is the basics of what you’ll need:

1. 4×4 vehicle in good mechanical condition

1. Camping equipment, basically tents & sleeping bags

1. Personal saman (it will be cold, so jackets etc.)

1. Drinking water for your party for three days

1. thats about it

Item 1 on the list is the toughest, but items 2-5 can be arranged for if you don’t have those.
