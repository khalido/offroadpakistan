From ‘Autoblog’ <http://www.autoblog.com/entry/1234000877026683/>

> Powered by two 5.7-liter Hemi engines (yes two) one in the front and one in the back that deliver up to 670hp and 740 lb-ft of torque. The engines can be used together or independently and can deliver 4-, 8-, 12- or 16-cylinders worth of power with the Multi-Displacement System. This thing is the ultimate in 4×4 vehicles with 20 inches of suspension travel, 14.3 inches of ground clearance and all four wheels can be turned to crab-crawl sideways without changing the direction the vehicle is pointed.
