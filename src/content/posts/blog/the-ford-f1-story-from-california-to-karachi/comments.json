And more after we have been to the desert (mid Nov).</p>\n\n\t<p>On the test trials: Ride is a bit rough compared to say later model Toyota Prado or Surf – but that was expected due to stiffer suspension suitable for off-roading. When loaded with camping gear etc. the ride will be much better! It is full time 4 wheel drive and climbs 50degree ‘mittee’ (mud) slopes easily without slipping tyres in normal gearing – with low range 4 wheel drive it seems it will climb near verticle slopes! The BFgoodridge tyres provede very good grip so that helps also. Tried same slope on Surf (normal gearing) – the wheels just slipped and would not climb up at all! Well more later.</p>\n\n\n",

      "content": "<p>Yes, as a long-time resident from the Sacramento area I can attest that most vehicles here, never exposed to road salt, ocean-spray nor even much rain, can last almost forever before rusting significantly. It is common for cars which are 30-40 years old to be in showroom condition if the owners have tended to waxing and washing. I am driving one now which is almost 20 yrs old and it’s body and even upholstery are nearly perfect. Perhaps I should organize a business to enable more such projects. Congratulations on a very nice restoration and revitalization project! Love the website too. Kudos!</p>\n\n\n",
