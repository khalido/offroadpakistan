<h1>Jeep Re-builders</h1>
<h3 class="author">by Taimur Mirza</h3>

<p>There was a time when Jeeps were only owned and maintained by the either the Landlords for a visit to the lands or shikari's <em>(hunters)</em> or contractors engaged in construction/mining in remote areas. With the introduction of Pajero&#8217;s and Land Cruiser&#8217;s a more comfortable approach to the wilderness was available to the not so outdoors kind. Pakistan Army, the single largest possessor of Jeeps gradually phased out the American Legend and replaced its fleet with Toyotas, the auctioned Jeeps found their way in the driveways of enthusiasts, sparkling and shining re-built by a few Master professionals. </p>
<p>Only a few mechanics specialize in re-building Jeeps in Karachi like Ghani, Late Dawood whose son now manages the workshop, Laloo, Noor Mohammad and Ustaad (Teacher) Shafi. Of these Late Dawood and Noor Mohammad were apprentices of Shafi, and like countless other apprentices, having learnt the skills and the ability to manage their own workshops ventured to start a new life, of course, with the blessings of their tutor &#8211; quite unlike the colleges, technical institutes and Universities conferring Degrees and Diplomas to successful candidates- they started their careers as mechanics. Dawood progressed to achieve International fame in re-building vintage Jeeps and restoring some of the finest, now in the collection of the rich and famous.</p>

<p>In their 40 odd years of professional lives they further passed on training and skills to countless number of students most of who are excellent mechanics themselves repairing cars and public transport vehicles, however, Shafi, like Dawood and Ghani mostly re-build Jeeps or other 4X4 vehicles.</p>

<p><img src="http://offroadpakistan.com/images/2007/shafi.jpg" alt="" height="356" width="475" class="big" /></p>

<p>My first encounter with Shafi was almost twenty years back when I had a 1974 Jeep with a 4 cylinder petrol engine. Driving back from the beach one day I took the Mirza Adam Khan Road and saw five or six jeeps parked outside a workshop, without thinking twice I turned into the gate and stopped, there were people working on Jeeps and all of them were sort of stunned at my behavior of trespassing that imaginary line, looking at me not moving, as if frozen. I stepped out and asked who the mechanic was, and a simple looking elderly man approached me and said; <strong>'aaaan bolo'</strong> (yes what can I do for you). I said my vehicle was a gas guzzler and the carb needed adjustment; <strong>'pachaas rupiya ooaenga'</strong> (it&#8217;ll be fifty rupees) he replied without even looking under the hood what the problem was. I said I needed the work done not how much it would cost, and again it was the same reply in the typical Baluchi accent, I nodded in agreement. Ever since I have had millions of conversations with him covering a vast range of subjects; Jeeps, technology, space travel, National Geographic and Discovery Channel, drought, rainfall, politics, love affairs, family matters, boozing and prohibition, off roading, and movies; here I must mention his favorite actors; <strong>'Butt Lungbaashter'</strong> and <strong>'Crack Dugluss'</strong> were heroes of his era and the best movie ever made is <strong>'Mecknas gold'</strong>.</p>

<p>Over the years Shafi has re-built over hundred Jeeps all according to the individual choice of customers ranging from heavy truck owners using jeeps for carting truck spares in case of breakdowns, hunters who normally are serious of-roaders use Jeeps for their hunting trips, non 4X4 enthusiasts who just for the sake of having a Jeep for an occasional drive along the Beach Avenue on weekends, people either living or working on exploration, mining or construction projects in remote areas of Sindh and Baluchistan. Then there are these groups of people who are constantly out to discover shrines of Sufi saints in the most inaccessible and remote parts and religiously visit one or the other every Thursday evening, the further the shrine is away from civilization and the harsher the terrain the higher in esteem is the saint with no dearth of stories of miracles. And finally, there is a group of people like me who feel limbless without a Jeep, who have been rendered incapable of driving even the best luxury car available, their existence synonymous with Jeep and who venture out of cities once in a while on camping and off roading trips, in short for my type of customers, Jeep is a necessity and Shafi fully understands our requirements.</p>

<p>Having passed his knowledge down to his two sons, Ayub and Omar, It would take a lifetime for them to equal the experience and wisdom of 45 years of Shafi&#8217;s life, successfully re-building some of the finest Jeeps in Karachi. Standing, looking out through the 2nd floor window of his comfortable retreat with glazed eyes, he once said; <strong>'kaisa zamana badal gaya hai, bohat achaa waqt guzara hai mae nae is shehr Karachi maen.'</strong> (How times have changed, I have lived a full life in this city called Karachi.) </p>

<p>Great article, a real pleasure to see someone write on the subject of jeeps and rebuilding them. I have been going to Laloo for over a decade now, Hos sons have taken up the same line of work but are more jeep mechanics than rebuilders. Really nice to know there are others out there that share the same passion, Jeeps.</p>

<p>Hey i`m Sameer, I live in Lahore.It started with like a week back when i started taking interest to build a jeep for myself. The actual motive of the jeep would not be to indulge itself into full time off roading but sometimes for the sake of fun. Basically i would like to have some info about where to buy the jeep from ? where to get a new engine from ? questions like these are bluging out from my head and after colsulting your website and reading these articles i decided to post you for help. My basic objective would be to get built a attractive wide body converted jeep maybe a new model of CJ7 could work out very well or you suggest me any other model available in the local market. I certainly do expect a reply from you. And with the detail of the workships the resale showrooms and all .... Expecting for an early reply .. ( i need information regarding Lahore`s accesibility )ThanXx </p>

<p>Sameer,<br />
I suggest you take a trip to Pindi and check out the re-builders there, some excellent work is being done there and good sturdy offroad Jeeps are re-built. It would be cheaper and you would have hands on experience while your dream jeep is being made besides knowing your vehicle inside out, a pre requisite for an offroader.<br />
All the best.</p>

<p>We are also in the making of 4&#215;4 jeeps with the exception that we specialize in giving our own design to the vehicles. <br />
In case you or your members are interested in 4&#215;4 jeeps (custom made) we are there.</p>

<p>Excellent Article by Taimur ! Recently I bought Pajero '92.  The only thing that worries me is its engine, its weak, yet the mech I consulted recommends not to rebuild it but better change it. Any idea where can i get a good 2800CC intercooler sound one (on exchange basis) Or if anyone who can testify that Ustad Ghani should have a second look at it before i decide to change it.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot to everyone.</p>
