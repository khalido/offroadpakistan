I am looking for my friend who i have lost 3 months back. I m indeed very worried for him. Its just like a matter of life and death for me. I dont remember his exact location in Quetta. but it was some place in Quetta Cantt. Can You please provide me with a list of different areas of Quetta Cantt. He told me the name of the area and road and I already knew that place’s name although i was unaware that it was inside Quetta itself. I thought it to be somewhere around Quetta. The name of the road is also very famous. I remember there was a bomb blast or firing incident on an army convoy last year on that road. its a very famous road. Please do help me sir. I can only offer you prayers for your benovelence.</p>\n\n\t<p>waslaam</p>\n\n\t<p>Wasim Abbas</p>\n\n\t<p>wasimzmail@yahoo.com, itswazim@yahoo.com, wasim512@hotmail.com</p>\n\n\n",
