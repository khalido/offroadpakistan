**Travelogue:**

We were made very welcome at Uncle Amins and Saima took us around the shopping centers. I went to the old house we used to live in, 19- E -1, Gulberg 111, the old building has been pulled down and a new structure greeted me, it does not seem to be the same neighborhood I remember.

The whole area has changed and Lahore has a new feel to it now. Liberty market, Model town have all been transformed into new localities. F.C. College is the same though and I took the kids around the college grounds, it brought back memories of the football practice and cricket matches that I played as a youngster there.

The day was spent roaming around the city of Lahore. We had dinner in the evening with Uncle Amin and sat for hours talking of the mischief we got upto as teenagers in the good old days.
