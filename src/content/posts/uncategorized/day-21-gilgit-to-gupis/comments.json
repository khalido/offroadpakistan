Its not limited to Gulmit,</p>\n\n\t<p>home made wine can be found all over Northern Pakistan. It is known as</p>\n\n\t<p>&#8220;Hunza water&#8221; a.k.a. Mulberry wine. Different qualities with varying</p>\n\n\t<p>levels of potency are available. Red wine is also available.</p>\n\n\t<p>I do not suggest travelling outside the Northern Areas as inter</p>\n\n\t<p>provincial border posts have very strict checking for narcotics and</p>\n\n\t<p>tend to check the vehicle inside out. Alcohol is also prohibited and</p>\n\n\t<p>especially ferrying it across the <span class=\"caps\">NWFP</span> border can cause <span class=\"caps\">MAJOR</span></p>\n\n\t<p>problems.</p>\n\n\n ",
