      "content": "\t<p>Yes, the track for the Old Buzi Pass goes through the river bed. It crosses the river by the remnants of a washed-away bridge. This same track is used to access the Nani Mandir. But where the jeeping gets interesting is when you leave the river bed and start climbing up through the hills. While the view from the Coastal Highway of the sea is magnificent, from the old road they are something else.</p>\n\n\n ",

Hence</p>\n\n\t<p>I shared it with <span class=\"caps\">FWO</span> trucks, dumpers and the trucks/buses going</p>\n\n\t<p>to gwadar. It was dusty. And I was more worried about getting</p>\n\n\t<p>to gwadar (still about 400kms away), rather than enjoying the</p>\n\n\t<p>view. Believe me, it was quite an epic journey.
