      "content": "\t<p>Thanks for the good words Sheheryar. Here are the answers to the questions you asked&#8230;</p>\n\n\t<p>1)wat are the main issues which one should keep in mind apart from water nd food supplies.</p>\n\n\t<p>Ans. I think, the first and the foremost issue is of the security. Although we did not faced any kind of threat, nor experienced anything, but living anywhere in Pakistan you should always keep your ears and eyes open <img src='http://komac.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>\n\n\t<p>The second issue is communication. If any mishap occurs at the top, how would you communicate it to the world? Mobile communication do not work there if you are lucky enough you might be able to catch V-PTCL signals. So don&#8217;t forget to take one hand set with you.</p>\n\n\t<p>Do ya prefer for one to take own Jeep to over ther or is it better to hire one from the Hyderabad/Sehwan?</p>\n\n\t<p>Ans. Well its better to have your own jeep, but it should be the jeep and you should have good experience of driving it in difficult mountainous tracks.</p>\n\n\t<p>If one needs to hire then what is the approximate rental?</p>\n\n\t<p>Ans. Sorry, I am unable to answer this question as all of our trip arrangements including the transportation was arranged by the local <span class=\"caps\">NGO</span>. I think you better ask Khalid Omer or other jeep lovers out here.</p>\n\n\t<p>Wats the position of Rest HOuse, how many persons can it accomodate?</p>\n\n\t<p>Ans. It could hardly be called a resthouse as one of the rooms is being used as a store whereas the goats and the chickens are being kept in the Sehen. There is only one room with attached bath but its better to use the cool open air environment than to use that toilet <img src='http://komac.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> . But anyways it still a good place to take a shelter in the stormy night that we have faced their. Dont forget to take lots of blankets or warm clothes with you as it is really chilly out there at the top.</p>\n\n\t<p>Wat are the prior requisities for booking/arranging the rest house?</p>\n\n\t<p>Ans. Since our trip has been arranged by the local <span class=\"caps\">NGO </span>(Shadabad Welfare Organization) who are also the promoters of tourism at Gorakh Hill. I think if you contact them, they ll be more than happy to arrange the booking of rest house for you.</p>\n\n\t<p>Is it preferable to take a local guide?</p>\n\n\t<p>Ans. Yeah, definitely.</p>\n\n\t<p>Ainï¿½t it feasible to spent a night at Sehwan and to leave for Gorakh in the morning, wat is the ideal time ya suggest?</p>\n\n\t<p>Ans. Depends upon the time you have. It takes you four to five hours to reach the top from Wahi Pandi and that is the most difficult part of the whole trip. Otherwise the rest of the trip is relatively easy and comfortable.</p>\n\n\n ",

But greenry is not all there is to it: Think of what else can be done there, taking advantage of the cool climate. And even greenry can be introduced to some extend by watering, plantations. Think of quick escape from the plains when the temperature can be around 50 Celsius. Think of the panoramic views from the top. Think of the opportunities for trekking, golfing&#8230;. So greenry, while definitely my love, is great, there is a lot of beauty in ruggedness too. Think how the deserts of Arizona have so many appealing places. Think the appeal of the god-forsaken places like Death Valley. Gorakh will find its places in the &#8216;hill stations&#8217; of the Pakistan. It will take time but at least it has started&#8230;.</p>\n\n\n ",

Its really a nice place to see but i think govt. just need to focus on plantation on this site with other development works. It was our badluck that we didn&#8217;t climb up to the peak due to heavy blasting onto the top 5kms of the road but we managed to climbed up to the 51 km of that hill.</p>\n\n\t<p>We travelled by Toyota double cabin Vigo, left Hyderabad at 6:30am yesterday and reached WahiPandi at 10:15am, the road from Hyderabad to Johi is really fantastic, but i think there should be a bypass for Johi to facilitate those who needs to cross Johi to reach Wahi Pandi.</p>\n\n\t<p>Well it took us 6.5 hours from Karachi to the top and 5 hrs to get back to Karachi from Gorakh. All because of the reasonable condition of the roads and offcourse the Vigo. Well Inshallah we will visit again to Gorakh as soon as the roads will be completed and i hope in next 6 mnths govt. will be able to finsih it.</p>\n\n\t<p>Regards to you all</p>\n\n\t<p>Ali Khan</p>\n\n\n ",

The road condition is OK and the top and the mid section is still under construction, but there are at least two sections of the climb which are very steep and must be negotiated with care.</p>\n\n\t<p>1.Condition of the Vehicle should be 100%, new 4&#215;4s are recommended. There is a greater chance of developing clutch , break and gear problems.</p>\n\n\t<p>2.Do not negotiate your descent on breaks, the break discs tend to get very hot and loose breaking strength, this happened to one of the vehicle and nearly rammed the front jeep. Descent slowly with 4&#215;4 engaged, this slows yr speed and give you more control.</p>\n\n\t<p>3. Snakes are a plenty at the top specially in summer, we killed one Russell&#8217;s wiper in front of the rest house.</p>\n\n\t<p>4. Electricity has been installed, water pumping system would be up by October.</p>\n\n\t<p>5. One thing that is most amazing is the ecology of the mountain after 3000 feet, it is the rarest in sind. The plant life is totaly alpine with wild olives and moisture retaining foliage. I spotted a flock of 10 chakors which is ver very rare is sind. Ecology of this mountain must be saved before it wiped out by development.</p>\n\n\t<p>6. Sustainable development is the word for this mountain. Be carefull&#8230; we might loose a great and may be the only peice of alpine ecology in sind.</p>\n\n\n ",

The Highest Mountain Elevation in Sindh, is \"KOH BENAZIR\" at 7,057 ft. above sea level, followed by another nearby peak, at 6,860 ft, then comes Kuttay ji Qabr at 6,800 ft. [KJQ was earlier considered the highest Peak of Sindh as per govt of Sindh Survey Department Records]. \n\nIt should be noted that there are dozens of 5500 + ft Peaks in the Kirthar's Sindh segment ... one of these elevations is GORAKH HILL STATION PLATEAU ... with an Average Elevation of 5,600 ft above Sea Level.\n\nBy the way, the Muree's Mall Road has an average Elevation of 7000 ft , and less than KOH BENAZIR ... ! \n\nNorth of KOH BENAZIR is the much larger [4 square miles] Plateau, of DHARIOARI ... at an Average Elevation of 6,200 feet ...",

Old vehicle normally heat up while ascending.It took 2.25 hrs. to reach Gorakh TOP from VAHI-PANDI. \n*It is advised when coming down the hill, use low gears mostly to control the speed, More use of  brakes will heat up the pads and brakes will Fail.\n*Around 36KM from WAHI PANDI(on route to Gorakh) there is a beautiful WATER FALL called Ginger Fall but the way leading down the Fall is KACHA road and a difficult one even for 4X4 Vehicles(we did manage to see the water fall).\n*Never go to  GORAKHA HILL in Rainy season because the KACHA patches of road will be washed away by water. \nPl. contact Mr. Ali Zaman 0312-2965869 for more information",
