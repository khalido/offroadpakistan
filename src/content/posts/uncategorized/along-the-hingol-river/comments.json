The terrain is beautiful and it kept changing from plains to mountains to desert to virgin sea belt throughout the coastal highway. Its a worth-see place for a person who enjoys the nature. I will be writing in detail about it.

For those of you who do not have 4WD vehicles, these areas are easily accessible even on saloon cars and believe me, these are a must visit areas if you are an adventure lover without the luxury of a 4WD. Just a simple advice, keep an eye open for the flash floods especially during raining season when in Hanglaj valley. Road to Nani Mandir is breath taking, just take the Makran Coastal Highway off <span class=\"caps\">RCD</span> highway at zero point and take a right turn just before Hangol River Bridge and you just cannot miss the Nani Mandir.</p>\n\n\n ",
