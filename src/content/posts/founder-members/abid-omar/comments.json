      "content": "<p>it sounds like you guys over there know what  your doing with regards to rebuilding 4×4’s. i only run bronco2 stuff myself. i have a 1986 bronco2 that i bought in colorado u.s and drove back to nova scotia in 1998. Mine is basically stock but i tore out the 2.9l efi engine and rebuilt it /overbored it. it also has a custom(slightly illegal) exhaust. it has been the best  little truck both on road and off , although a slight tendency to bust hubs. i was slightly taken aback when you said that yours had a lot of ?<img src=\"plastic\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" />? body panels. i wish i could get my hands on some of those!!(the salt we put on the roads in winter eats steel alive) i will try and post a picture of my truck when i get a web- cam . keep on truckin’ in Pakistan<img src=\"!\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n\n\n",

I have been looking for a decals that goes on the side of Toyota 4Runner and or Land C (Side doors) or a while now, but no luck finding them here in <span class=\"caps\">USA</span>. I saw these decals when I was in Pakistan long time ago. Some landlords with there Nissan Petrol, or Land C would have these on their SUVs. These decals have pictures of mountains or countryside of Pakistan.</p>\n\n\t<p>Do any of you Jeep lovers can tell me where I can find these Sahara Stickers (Decals)?</p>\n\n\t<p>Thanks</p>\n\n\t<p>Murad</p>\n\n\t<p>muradakram@gmail.com</p>\n\n\n",

Did you folks write any articles? Would be nice if you could post it here.</p>\n\n\t<p>Any more river expeditions?</p>\n\n\t<p>Some teams should be encouraged to come down the Indus – all the way. The 1978 -27 year old record of the longest recorded voyage down the Indus remains unbeaten. There were three attempts but each had to portage long distance due to lack of navigable waters. Would love to see some one improve the record! That is a challenge – any takers?</p>\n\n\t<p><span class=\"caps\">KM </span>Ali</p>\n\n\n",
