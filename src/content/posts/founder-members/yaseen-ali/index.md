**Jeep profile:** It’s copper in colour with a black hard top, chromed 15 inch steel wheels, stainless steel rear bumperettes, tow hitch and standard front bumper. Equipped with a T-5, it has extremely tall gear ratios, which make it feel car-like but the Dana 300’s granny low gearing makes it quite capable off-road. Originally acquired with an antiquated Toyota 3.0L NA diesel engine, the Jeep now has a V8. Apart from the engine, even after 23 years this Jeep has surprisingly retained most of its originality – it even came with the original space saver donut spare tire!
