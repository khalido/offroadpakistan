      "content": "<p>An internal valve broke in the <span class=\"caps\">RS9000</span>’s. They work fine one way, but the other way they move freely. I am now going to put in Class 8 Monroe shocks used large trucks. Those should do the job! The problem with the Willy’s is that the wheel travel is more than the range of the shock, and there aren’t any shocks available which adequately cover both the compressed and extended length. Ideally, the shock mount needs to be higher up on the chassis or have more of an angle.</p>\n\n\n",
