      "content": "Hi Hamid, hope you are gud. I am a proud owner of a 1980 CJ7 Hard Top.  I have been exploring Pakistan since I was a child.  In last 8 years I have been exploring different locations on my bike Honda CD200 Road Master 1981.  I have been to Lahore from Karachi on my bike & Iran Border from Karachi on the same bike using Coastal Highway.  Also been to Hingol National Park, Mud Volcanoes, Nani Mandir, Nani Pir after Lasbela, Pir Bukkur, Moen Jo Daro in my bike.\r\n\r\nAn engineer & working in a multi-national company belong to Balochistan, residing in Karachi.\r\n\r\nSince I have a jeep now that was purchased specially for the same reason mentioned above.  I need to join your group to experience off-roading.  I hope you would meet & welcome myself.  Looking forward to your kind reply.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nAdil M.",
