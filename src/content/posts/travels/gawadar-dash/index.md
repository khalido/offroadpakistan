[A mad dash to Gawadar from Lahore and back:](http://docs.google.com/View?docid=a27fgdb8g4_22fjnxhj)

> The story you are about to read, is a story of self-proclaimed adventure, misery, apathy, a mix of un-daunting and daunting courage and insaneness in the literal and/or emotional sense of the words. The story revolves around three people namely myself, Adeel aka ABC and Sufyan aka corky. Together these characters attempted to drive from Lahore to Gawadar and back in 4 days.

Writeup by Umer Shah. I leave you to comment on itâ€™s madness!
