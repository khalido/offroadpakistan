It all began when the Omar family was in Islamabad for the Winter Vacations. They stayed with Azam Jaffar, the mastermind who made up the Great Idea. It was a dark and dreamy night, with the rain and high winds buffeting the sides of the building. With no electricity there was nothing to do. It was then that Azam Jaffar came up with the Great Idea. He and Hamid Omar sweated for hours over a map under the suffocating heat of a candle (DarkSucker). Throughout the night they sat there hunched over the map. Then in the morning, as soon as the electricity came back, Azam Jaffar jumped and shouted, “Eureka, we have perfected the Great Idea.”

The Great Idea was to make a trip to the Northern Areas of Pakistan by jeep. It was to begin from the coastal city of Karachi, from there a rush to Rahim Yar Khan in Punjab and onward to the quaint city of Lahore. The capital Islamabad, from where the trip was to really begin. Going through Mingora in Swat Valley to Chitral, a major station in the Northern Areas, and from there to the famous valleys, Kalas, Mastooj, Phander and finally the main destination, Tirich Mir, a small town above the polo grounds of Shandur Pass. Then back to Karachi following the same route.

Most of the time the Trippez would stay in PTDC Rest Houses, and a few days in their own camps in the middle of nowhere. The food was to be brought on the way and some was taken along for energy rations.

### The Jeeps:

Four jeeps were conned into going on with the Great Idea. Intensive preparations transformed the Jeeps into Heavy Duty Off Road 4×4 Vehicles, basically All Terrain Vehicles (ATV). They are as follows:
