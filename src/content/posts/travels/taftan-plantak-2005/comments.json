I travelled a similar route in 1967 on a drive from the U.K to Lahore in a long wheelbase Landrover. You brought back many fond memories of friendly people and great food once through the desert!</p>\n\n\t<p>Itâ€™s gratifying to know that people with adventurous spirits are still exploring in this fashion. I wish you may more great trips.</p>\n\n\t<p>Peter</p>\n\n\n",

Feels great to relive those moments... even the ones when I thought I was going to be the one idiot running out of fuel in the middle of the Mashkhell Desert, only to have my worries terminated abruptly by the misery of a broken clutch!",
