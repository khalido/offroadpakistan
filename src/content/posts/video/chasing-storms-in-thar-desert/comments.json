I don’t know whether I am right or wrong but I expect lot more support from jeeps that was missing in this movie… but at the same time my love to buy a jeep is now sky high. Just looking for good vehicle and above all to convince my dad <img src='http://komac.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>\n\n\t<p>Can I ask one thing! the guy in Parado in back seat (with blue shirt). Why he joined the trip if he don’t want to come out of jeep?  In video, he was in jeep all the time….I m really sorry but I don’t like that <img src='http://komac.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /></p>\n\n\t<p>On spot fixing of wheel puncher was really very interesting. But I wonder how they fill ups the air…Is it from other spare wheel?</p>\n\n\t<p>Thumbs up for the guy who fixed the Radiator. !</p>\n\n\t<p>Keep it up!</p>\n\n\n",
