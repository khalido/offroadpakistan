Why he joined the trip if he don’t want to come out of jeep?  In video, he was in jeep all the time….I m really sorry but I don’t like that <img src='http://komac.local/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /></p>\n\n\t<p>On spot fixing of wheel puncher was really very interesting.
