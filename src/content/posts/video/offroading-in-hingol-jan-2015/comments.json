      "content": "hello,\r\n  i am from germany and was travelling in 1984 from germany to nepal overland with some friends. we went from quetta to karachi via khuzdar and las bela. from there we wanted to go to gadwar, but the road was so bad that we had to turn back after about 100km. our little truck had no 4wheel drive. but i saw some of that wild countryside. now i saw your video and i really liked it. brings back old memories when travel in pakistan was nice and safe. all the best for you guys. may peace prevail. we are all one.",
