I was amazed to know about a shakti peeth which was laid barren by the slaughter of partition. but i always have a faith in the power of mata that the people who live around ( whose forefathers at some ancient time would have reverred the Mata) are still blessed. I earnestly desire to visit the Mata.

Back in 1986 while looking through the map of Balochistan I came across a name written in Old English Script "Sri Mata Hinglaj". Imagining it to be a small village with a scenic touch alongside the river with the Temple being the focal point I asked Hamid Omar and Fasih Khan to visit this place.
Contrary to my imagination the Temple, then only a raised platform about 3 feet high with two small enterances on either side creating a room with three feet high cieling, the platform was open from three sides while the fourth joined the base of the mountain and the figure of Mata on top with a baby cot alongside with other objects of religious importance. This was neatly built in the depression of a 1000 feet high mountain with a stream running in front through lush green vegetation in the narrow valley.
The construction visible in this picture and more on the other side have been made during the second half of 90's and even the Temple platform itself has now been enclosed in a room and not visible anymore.
More on this soon.....

**Ishan Kundu** - September 25, 2006  4:51 PM

I am from West Bengal, India. Anyone kindly help for getting a week's Pak pilgrimage visa from N.Delhi embassy which is the foremost problem. Others known to me also need it. I have a lifetime wish to see the holy shrine of Mataji along with my family. I intended for it long back but couldn't do so due to lack of information and connection. Whoever is trying to organise a trip in 2007 kindly respond. Why don't we join his hands ! If the trip has to be a little economic, we all can travel by rail through Rajasthan by the newly opened Munnabao - Khokhrapar line (THAR EXPRESS)and then towards Karachi via Mirpur Khas by Pakrail.
All this after getting a Visa which is a real problem.Please keep contact by e-mail : ishankundu@yahoo.co.uk

Even I want to visit Mata Hinglaj & Katasraj. My forefathers were based in West Punjab and migrated to India during partition. I visited Lahore for watching cricket match but since both govt. give city based visa I could not visit any other place. People are excellent and hospitality superb.

Mata Hinlaj Mandir is situated at Balouchistan Province of Pakistan @ Karachi-Gwadar Highway at Aghor Point. Nearby 250 Km from Karachi and 30 Km from Aghore Point into the mountains. Hinglaj Shewa Associations in different cities of Pakistan are working to promote this holy place for foreign pilgrams also. This place darshan take a more value than Haridwaar in Hinduism Believers. Best months of visit are December to April. If anyone wants to visit this Holy Place, Then come to Karachi at Swami Narayan Temple, Karachi. 24 Hour service available to go to Hinglaj in Private or Rental Vehicle. You can e-mail me to guide u more or can ask any quetion relating to Hinglaj Yatra. ( pmrajpal@yahoo.com )

**PRANAV DAVE** - August 27, 2009  5:28 PM

Jay HINGLAJ MAA
THERE IS SOME SPELLING MISTAKES IN LAST COMMENT THAT A TEMPLE IS NEAR MEHSANA(GUJRAT).
ONE MORE THING TO SHARE WITH MY BROTHERS THAT AMONG ALL 52 SHAKTIPEETHS HINGLAJ AND AMBAJI ARE ON THE TOP AS WHEN THE PARTS OF BODY OF SATIMAT CUT AND FELL ALL OVER THE MOUNTAINS.. THE HEAD-first main part of body fell at pakistan n its known as first SHAKTIPEETH SHREE HINGLAJ MATAJI and THE HEART-another main part of body fell on GABBAR at Danta in Banaskantha district Gujrat N its known as SHAKTIPEETH AMBAJI.....most of us hindus visited Ambaji many times in our lifes as it is very easy to go there so it is popular..BUT MAA HINGLAJ STHANAK AT Pakistan is similar important as Ambaji but there r many difficulties to go there but all of us try to convince both governments of India n Pakistan to make easy a journey to MAA HINGLAJ STHANAK...if we cant do that than shame on us because if our mother is out of our reach n after a lon long time if we r not able to see or care her than its a shmeful for all of us...as the mother who give birth us MAA HIGLAJ is the mother of all n she made us so this is my heartly request to all my brothers that think about it pleaze..
JAY MAA HINGLAJ...... OM HINGULE PARAM HINGULE TANU SHAKTI MANUH SHIVE...HINGULAYAI NAMAH....

Jai Shri Hinglaj !
Thanks. Thanks for the giving a holly and wonderfull knoladge. I am a charan. Charan's real origine by the Hinglaj. In my cast we belive that when any child born in charan cast, the Hinglaj Mata is awaiting to them. The Hinglaj Mata wants that the every Charan come here and see the holly tample. We also belive that if we reached at this tample we are elegibale to MOKSHA.
My hartly thank for u, not from me but also from every Charan of India & every Charan of world. I want to come to this holly palace, that is my home. Dekhte hai ki ma ki kripa kab hoti hai.
Hum aapke yahan aayen or aap humare yahan. Par pata nahi kyon kuch log nahi chahte ki ye dono Mulk aman-chain se bhai-bhai ki tarah rahe. again thanks for thease. Jai Shri Mataji. Manoj Charan, Ratangarh (Churu) Raj. India.
