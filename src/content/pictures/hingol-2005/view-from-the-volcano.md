Excellent work guys, please keep it up and please feed your websites links to all major search engines like google and yahoo so Pakistan can get a well deserving presence in world as a country where you can affordably go and enjoy. People here in US don't even know we have so much to offer all they think is Pakistan is a war zone.

Great photographs. Seems like an exotic trip through a rugged terrain. Reminded me at times of Utah country side. Hope I will be brave enough to visit Pakistan some day soon :) Though in the current political state even my Pakistani friends are not encouraging me much...Very curious about the livelihood of people residing in those 3 huts.

Fantastic pictures, thank you. They have rekindled my desire to visit Hing Laj. Perhaps I'll take my paraglider and ride some volcanic thermals...
