Hello dear friends

I am Chinmay Deshpande from Bhopal , India. This is picture of idol of Goddess Durga.
Hinglaj Mata is one of 52 known shaktipeeths , after partition this region became un accessable to Indians as it went in Pakistan. For more information about Hinglaj mata and yatras please visit this website:-

I am delighted to see that people of pakistan have maintained this lone hindu temple in the region and saved it from destruction by religious fanatics. Infact this is perfect example that common man of both countries India & Pakistan want peace.
Hats off to people of pakistan for their generosity and maintaining such a beautiful site.
Thanks to the people who have given me the opportunity to view this Hinglaj Mata Temple. Indeed you guys have enjoyed the long journey.

May Goddess Hinglaj mata bless you all.

I Ramesh LILADHAR BHANUSHALI belong to THE KUTCHHI BHANUSHALI community. MAA HINGLAJ is our KULDEVI.
We have grand temples of MATA at all our key community properties. One is in Naliya, Tal. Abdasa, Kutch, Gujarat.INDIA another is at BHANUSHALI WADI, GHATKOPAR, MUMBAI, INDIA. The darshan of MATA is the most pious activity for us and the yatra to its "Mulsthan" is the greatest of all yatras. I hope that the travelling permissions are relaxed and so that everybody can afford to travel to this TEMPLE.

JAI MAA HINGLAJ

**Ramchandra P Khatri** - February 23, 2008  4:39 PM

Hi guys,

I belong to the cast BrahmKshatriya , Maa Hinglaj is our KulDevi. Just for the knowledge, We were originally the Kshatriyas but named BrahmKshatriyas after that HINGLAJ MATA has saved whole of the Kshatriya community form a Brahmin named Parshuram, who was on a mission to kill all Kshatriyas on earth. Because of injustice spread by Kshatriya Rajas (Kings) of those times (A long story).

A few of Kshatriyas remained on earth as Parshuram has killed the most, and Kshatriyas took thier way to HINGLAJ MATA to be rescued. HINGLAJ MATA ordered Parshuram to stop killing Kshatriyas , Parshuram agreed but told MATA that he has sworn to make the earth Kshatriya-less , and those words could not be lied, so MATA renamed Kshatriyas to BrahmKshatriyas on that place only. This is how we have been called BrahmKshatriya there after. Generally called Khatri Now a days.

Jai Mata Ji,

I feel proud that my uncle aged 75 from Sindhodi-Kutch has been granted visa for visiting the sacred place. I had a word with him and he shared with me his experience regarding how he had to convince the man in the consulate to grant him visa.

It was really a touching moment when he explained that why he wanted to visit this sacred place to the man who interviewed him for the visa. The man after hearing his answer promptly said to him (my uncle) that he need not worry and he has been granted visa.

**Sireesha** - October  8, 2008  5:24 PM

Jai maa Hinglaj.

Cannot tell you how important this day is in my life.

Got online darshan of mata HInglaj of Pakistan.
Through this email, my friends, I want to share with you a well known fact.
Mata Durga in all her forms blesses her children thoroughly.
Especially if you fast and pray during Navratras.

My application for an Australian VISA was lodged in the year 2002 with the process which is usually 12 months long prolongigin to 2 yaers and finally got rejected.

I was very close to Maa durga right from the start but did not know how to pray according to exact rites and rituals.

When I actually relocated to PUnjab, I started doing Navratras well and this Navratras on the ninth day MATA SIDDHI DATRI has made the IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE.

After 6 years when I and my family and my consultant had almost lost hopes, our visa is garnted and in a week's time I will be recieving my stamped visa whicxh is a permamnenet resident VISA to Australia.

One of my biggest dreams come true.

Mata rani is present , she is much aware of our dreams...she sees, feels and touches you. She cries when you are sad and makes the path of your life smooth for you....hey hey she punishes you if you do wrong so that you can realize your mistake ask for forgiveness and learn!

Jai maa Vaishno ki.Jai maa chintpurni ki.
Jai Mata HINGLAJ KI.

May your glory spread may people know you better.
get your blessings.

Please keep faith on her.

There is delay but no failure!!!

By the way this is general information of Hindu Community members from INDIA and overseas,the pictures on this site were taken and posted by proud Muslim Pakistanis.The group you saw in the series of Photograph are all Muslims.Being Muslim we are more open to Religious tolerance.We got big heart to tolerate hindu Temples and the idols of hindu dieties although those things are in direct confrontation of Islamic teachings.I read a lot about Hinduism those are only mythology and hearsay nothing to substatiate those tales.Look into the Buddhaism it is also very OLD religion yet lot of things of the religion can be physically proved.Any way open your mind and heart and Read about Islam and then compare between TRUTH and MYTHOLOGY.Do continue to believe in Hinduism but at the same time think with Logic.
