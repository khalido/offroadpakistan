This is a splendid collection of photos by OCK. Couldn't imagine that Baluch people are so good to have protected this hindu shrine till today. Wish to visit once. If I get any help from your side (OCK), ready to go at once with a week's pilgrimage visa. Hope to get reply.

I am a Hindu from India. These pictures show me that that Hindus and Muslims on both sides of the border can co-exist in peace and harmony. I dream of a day when we can live as brothers and sisters in peace without borders. Our destinies are inter-twined. ~~ Yogesh.
