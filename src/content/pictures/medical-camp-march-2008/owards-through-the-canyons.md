Awesome!!! I'd love to do a trip through the Asian sub continent. It doesn't really get very exciting over here in Australia because it's not as remote as it once was 30 years ago. i know some people who drove a VW combi from Germany to Australia vie Afghanistan and all that in the 70's. That would have been exciting. i might just put my car in a container and ship it over.
