Yes, Hamid, but not Much better.
It causes me to reflect on the many Blessings that I have and that we share in the USA and in MOST other places on the Planet.
If I had a lot of finances, I would give-give-give, to the peoples like those who attend schools like this.
Heavenly Father, I Pray for Special Blessings on ALL Who Will Pass Through the Doors/Walls of This School.
Fill them with food, water, clothing, as well as toys, and Most Importantly, Your Omnipotent Love.......
Thank You, My Lord and Creator of the Universe, In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.......!!!!!!!
Thank You and Amen....................................
