my ancestors were the inhabitants of Hinglaj, the region of Hingol, Kirthar and the surrounding areas, when Alexander's armny passed throught.

It is an awesome picture. Is there any protection from around this structure? The debris around the tombs show as if this site has been plundered ?? Do you see any writings on the wall? I am a history buff and would like to know.
