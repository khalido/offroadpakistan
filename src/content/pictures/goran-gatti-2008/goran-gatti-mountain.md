Goran Gatti Mountain (1050M High): It was still 11KM away when we had to turn back (due shortage of time) - next year we intend to make it all the way to the top!

;) too the top..... ;) ok thats a good challenge - how about a five dy trip just to get there - and one day spare for the climb - looks like a cliff hanger not for the faint hearted ;) scary at best
