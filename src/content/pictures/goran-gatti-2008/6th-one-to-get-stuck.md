6th one to get stuck (Toyota Hilux Vigo).: This one kept geting stuck, everywhere, again and again. We had made bets, that for every 'stucking',' the driver would hand out a Pepsi to all those around. He had plenty, so he always got pulled out, though by t (ed: caption stuck?)

Sajid - the passage was tight, and the wider wheel base of Vigo landed me into the 'gup' and once the front tire got entrapped it sucked the entire car to the left. observe the tire tracks (specially the front tier). and see how far it slid away. Though I could have been closer to the sidewall and but may have miscalculated the leading edge to the quick sand. But heck it was fun...
