Dear Hamid, Long time no see. Your son is your ditto copy. You were right about the pedigree!! Last time I saw him was in a baby crib in 1975. Your mom looks great. Take me along on your next trip(If you have space).I am in the U.S right now studying to be a Pharmacist. If you are in LHE in Nov2004 check me out..Love you ..Bhatti
