The plane landed too far up the runway. Notice the bent props - luckily no one got hurt. Pilots get only one chance to land at Chitral - they can't pull up for another go at landing once they are in the valley.

Is it full of danger to fly to Chitral?

Masd,
There are eleven weekly scheduled flights to and from Chitral (all are Peshawar-Chitral-Peshawar), and we don't see these emergency landings every day, so to summarize, I'd say no it's not life-threatening to fly to Chitral.

Now after the grounding of Fokkers, I don't know what the situation is nowadays, whether they use the new ATR-42 for any flights, or the C-130 for all flights or what.
