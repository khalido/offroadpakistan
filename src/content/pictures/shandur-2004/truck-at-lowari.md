Pakistan indeed is a beautiful land!
I like your photographs.
Tell me, can Indians ever be allowed to visit such places?

Salam Karam,
Shandur is in the middle of Chitral and Gilgit rather more closer to Chitral. The scenery is spectacular on the way from any sides and its a worth doing trip. I would specially mention Phandar Lake, Shandur Lake, Yasin Valley to name a few must see. I'll not recommend a visit during the polo tournament time as it has become a show off event for our elite so it is very crowded at that time.

I did this trip on a motor bike in 1992 and just recently I decided to write my travel blog at www.familyoffroaders.com. Look under 1992 and you'll find details about this route.
