I JUST ACCIDENTLY HIT THIS SITE ON A SLOW PACE DAY AT WORK. I WAS THINKING ABOUT HITTING UP THIS PARTICULAR AREA IN MY NEXT VISIT TO PAK AND UR WORK WILL HELP ME PRE-PLAN IT. I WONDER IF YOU GUYS CAN POST SOME MORE SPECIFICS LIKE ALTITUDES, HIKING TRACKS, LOCAL CARNIVALS, COMMUTE INSTRUCTIONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. GOOD WORK THOUGH
