This picture was taken with a Canon EOS 55 using Fuji Velvia 100 silde film. The red sky and enhanced depth of field and detail is courtesy of cross-processing in C41 chemicals.

About recommending a camera, that depends on where you live. If you are in Pakistan, then don't get a Canon as no one here knows anything about them and you'll be hard pressed to find any accessorices for the camera. Nikon would probably be the way to go, but that depends on your budget. But all in all, Canons offer more value and are easier to use.
