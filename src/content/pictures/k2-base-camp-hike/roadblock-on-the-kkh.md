jackass big rig driver... are they using ropes to pull it back up on its wheels? It's a miracle it didn't wind up in the river down below!

Just a tad bit more and it would have definitely been "Curtains" for this one.

They're using steel cables and pulleys to stop it from sliding in the river - in this picture they had already pulled it in a few feet in to the road.

What a great group of pictures. Looking at them one feels like it would be a shame to depart this world without visiting heaven that is on earth. Good job guys and all the best for your future trips.

Most spectacular. The Pictures are absolutely stunning. Must have been a great adventure. Thoroughly enjoyed seeing the sights and experiencing the place as if one was there.
