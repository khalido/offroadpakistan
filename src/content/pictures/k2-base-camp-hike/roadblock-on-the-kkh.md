jackass big rig driver... are they using ropes to pull it back up on its wheels? It's a miracle it didn't wind up in the river down below!

They're using steel cables and pulleys to stop it from sliding in the river - in this picture they had already pulled it in a few feet in to the road.

What a great group of pictures. Looking at them one feels like it would be a shame to depart this world without visiting heaven that is on earth. Good job guys and all the best for your future trips.
