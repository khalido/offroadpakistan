The story of Liligo: In the 1800s a British lady Lilly hiked this area along with her family and friends. She fell ill here and stayed here with a porter while the rest of her group hiked on. A couple of days later she passed away and the porter chased after the rest of the group screaming "Lilly Go! Lilly Go!". Hence the name Liligo was coined - at least that's what the guide told us.
