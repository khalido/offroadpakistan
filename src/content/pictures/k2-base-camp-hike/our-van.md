![Our Van](./IMG_0078.jpg)

The van in which we went from Isb to Skardu. The flight got canceled (as it always does because of weather), so we decided to go by road. Our van was the fastest on the road: we cut corners on the KKH, overtook every other vehicle in our way (especially when there was a critical blind spot) and tried to run over pedestrians wherever we could..
