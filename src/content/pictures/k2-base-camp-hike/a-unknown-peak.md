All the pictures of the treck to the K2 base camp were taken by Khalid Omar with a small Canon A640 Powershot camera. I have one too and its a very nice handy camera to use on off road and camping trips etc. Ho

I must say Khalid Omar you have done a wonderful job of taking the pictures. We are planning on doing this trip in 2011. Any suggestions how to make the trip better than your experience?
