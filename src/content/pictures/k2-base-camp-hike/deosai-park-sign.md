Deosai Plains make up one of the last frontiers of natural habitat for the Himalayan brown bear, a creature that once roamed the mountains freely. The park currently has inbetween 20-28 Brown bears. This park was establised to protect these endangered bears. Recently a research project has started by Himalayan Wildlife Foundation (HWF) and the Northern Areas Forests, Parks, and Wildlife Department to secure the survival of the brown bear in the Deosai Plains and to monitor their population. The Deosai Plains are also home to the ibex, red fox, golden marmot, wolf, the Ladakh urial, the snow leopard, and a number of resident and migratory birds. Info from Wildlife of Pakistan.

Two thumbs up my friend, what a great post and worthy of my comment of praise.
I normally hate commenting, but i thought i would give it a go for this blog. Been reading your stuff for awhile.
I adore you stories and i hope it is possible to maintain them coming. Honestly it's challenging to find an intriguing blog these days.
I read about a hundred blog posts a week and i tend to only comment on some of them, this is 1 of them.
Sorry i have not commented till now, i have been reading your blog for a even though now though. It has become component of my morning routine.
