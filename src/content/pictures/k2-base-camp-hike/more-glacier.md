Hey, great add-on, extremely pourefwl! But is there any way to, using the Export Import function, to import Firefox's headers? So then you have all the regular headers right there to work with. If so, where would the configuration files be found? Platform is probably all of them, which for these purposes would be Windows (7), OS X, and Linux (primarily Debian / Ubuntu based). version 4Thanks!!!
