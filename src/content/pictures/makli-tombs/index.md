A day's trip from Karachi, inspired by the book Footprints Pakistan.
This is one of the most visually stunning archaelogical sites in Pakistan. Covering 15-1/2 sqaure kilometers, and said to contain over one million tombs, it is considered to be the world's largest necropolis. The tombs and mausoleums are seen as the most substantial remains of Sind's greatness between the 14th and 18th centuries, with many belonging to kings, queens, saints, governors, military commanders, philophers and poets.
Makli is 98 km from Karachi - if you leave 10am, you should arrive by noon. 3 to 4 hours is the time you need to see the tombs etc. On the way back, you can stop at Haleji lake, which is populated by over 70 species if migratory aquatic birds, including flamingoes, pelicans, herons, egrets and pheasant tailed jacanas as well as marsh crocodiles.
