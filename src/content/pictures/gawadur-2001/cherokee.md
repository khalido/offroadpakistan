Yeah...I know how it feels I was there, sitting next to Hamid. It was a slow roll over.....was like watching a movie in slooow motion, but when it came to a complete stop, the horror of it all hit me real hard ....get me out of here...pronto!!

(Friends & relatives dont be alarmed I am alive & well)
