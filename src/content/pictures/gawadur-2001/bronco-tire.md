It was my father who was driving the Bronco then! We buggered two tires and had to buy one at this town. Turbat it was, I think.

But generally, I wouldn't recommend a Desert Dueler to anyone. They wear out too fast, and don't perform well at all on highways. Now we have Dunlop Grand Treks.

Dang, that one went out in style.
Slim- that's not a OJ style bronco. It's a completely different style Bronco
