This wouldn't have something to do with me by any chance now, would it??? :^D

I hope everybody's working on their own airborne stunts, hehe.

BTW, there's a road not too far away from here where you can hit the crest of a certain hill at about 100mph and the car will leave the ground. Feels somewhat like a roller coaster but 10 times more fun.
