Excuse me for being an ignorant geographically illiterate person... but where exactly is the "neza" in this picture?

That's a very good question. The Neza is behind the jeeps, this picture is from a small hill next to the Neza. All the jeeps were getting lined up for a group photo with Neza-e-Sultan in the background. Or as the caption says, Group photo from Neza-e-Sultan, not of it.
