The road to Neza-e-Sultan. After this stretch it went on vacation and we had to rely on the guide.

You have to admire the guides' idyllic sense of time and distance...

"How much further till we get there?"
"Oh, it's just around that next hill."

Three hours later...

"How much longer?"
"Just around this next hill."
