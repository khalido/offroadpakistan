In many photos, this jeep has been mentioned as the most powerful. What is the cc and is it Turbo charged?. A Toyota Landcruiser of 2446cc, short wheel base could negotiate any mountains this jeep has done, even half a meter of snow, a meter of river water and wheels sunk halfway in tropical mud. That is not powerful but normal with skillful driving. Perhaps more specifications on the mentioned Jeep would be helpful for other enthusiasts and potential owners.

Kahn, you can see the Jeep specs here: <http://offroadpakistan.com/founder_members/khalid_omar.html>

It's got a Toyota 2.4 Turbo Diesel engine, but it's the driver which makes it powerful, as u said!
