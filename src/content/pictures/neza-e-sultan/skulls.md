Sind:
Sindh (Sindhī: سنڌ, Urdū: سندھ) is one of the four provinces of Pakistan and historically is home to the Sindhis. Different cultural and ethnic groups also reside in Sindh including Urdu speaking people who migrated from India at the time of independence and partition as well as the people migrated from other provinces after independence. Neighbouring regions are Balochistan to the west and north, Punjab in the north, Rajasthan and Gujarat (India) to the east, and the Arabian Sea to the south. The main languages are Sindhi and Urdu. In Sanskrit, the province was dubbed Sindhu meaning "ocean". The Assyrians (as early as the seventh century BCE) knew the region as Sinda, the Persians Abisind, the Greeks Sinthus, the Romans Sindus, the Chinese Sintow, while the Arabs dubbed it Sind. It is mentioned to be a part of Abhirrdesh (Abhira Kingdom) in Srimad Bhagavatam [2]. Sindh was the first place where Islam spread in South Asia. As a result, it is often referred to as "Bab-al-Islam" (Gate of Islam).

Kuch aur sochne ki zarorat nahi mujhe,
Tere siwa kisi se mohabbat nahi mujhe,

Rehta hai bas tera hi mujhe raat din khayal,
Main tujh ko bhol jaon yeh taqat nahi mujhe,

Kal shab tumhari yaad mein aanso chilak pade,
Ab kuch bhi kehne ki hajat nahi mujhe,

Kis ko sunaon gi ke mein apna yeh hal-e-ahewal,
Tum ne to keh diya hai ke fursat nahi mujhe,

Khushiyon se ab nahi hai koi rabta mera,
Pal bhar tumhare ghum se faragat nahi mujhe,

Sab kuch ujar gaya mera khuwabon ke sath sath,
Faraz magar kisi se shikayat nahi mujhe...
