The train goes on top, and the cars go below. This bridge is now only used for bullock carts, as a new bridge has been made.

I live near this (Attock) bridge. on each side of this bridge there is a sign board of a warning,"Taking photo of this bridge is strictly prohibited". So you have taken a picture of this and you have broken the law.
