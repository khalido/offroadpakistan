the khushal garh bridge was constructed by british before independence.that was the 1st bridge for transporting both rail and vehicles at a time.upper portion for rail and lower there is road.but after its expiry it is only use as a road.it is in between Punjab and Pukhtoonkhwa province.Giving very beautiful view of Indus river.the road is called Pindi-Kohat road.
