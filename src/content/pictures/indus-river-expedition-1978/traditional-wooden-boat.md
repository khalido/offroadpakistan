It was just a chance that I visited your fabulous site. In fact I too had led India's first indus expedition in Ladakh and visited this very year Hingol(Pakistan). You can imagine the joy I had seeing Indus and Hingol both on your site. I am also a trekker and love fourwheeling wherever and whenever it is possible. Two years before I had visited western Tibet and Indus source region too. Would love to be friends with your group and exchange info/photos.
