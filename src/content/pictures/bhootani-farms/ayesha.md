If you climb to the top of the hill behind Ayesha, you can see similar terrain as far as the eye can see. It is one of the most beautiful sites.

As it is said that this place is to be visited in winters.

So whats the temperature of the water? Will I be able to get a dip? And is the water worth it?

The water gets very cold, but you certainly can take a dip.
