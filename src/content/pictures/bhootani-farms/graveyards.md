Hi all! I am really facinated by what you guys are doing? I am really happy because Pakistanis are generally not into adeventours-Their favorite past time on the weekends is watching third rated Indian Movies and Nahari and that is the recreation they have! I am a Karachite now living in Canada. I love Karachi and what Taimur Mirza and his team is doing and I thank him and
his team for showing what real Pakistan is! Please keep up the good work!
Thank
