Is that it near the lower right corner beyond the bushes? Looks to me like a jeep mired in the water.

I labelled the picture wrong. There is no Jeep anywhere in this picture.

Khalid - did you loose the Jeep?

I hope not! It could be that someone left the handbrake off and it rolled into the river... thats why everyone is intently looking at the water for signs of their transport.

Good jeep trick driving,raising a lot of dust and getting yourself camouflaged in it.Liked the pictures,keep it up.Next time get a deer closer with your searchlight,its easily possible and beautiful to watch,especially for those who see it for the first time.

Well! These are wonderful views and landscapes. Have you guys been to Khadeji fall which is in north-east of Karachi on super highway?
