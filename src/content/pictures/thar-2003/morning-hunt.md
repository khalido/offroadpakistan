Since it was just a scouting trip we were'nt really looking to shoot too much. I think Salman shot a few partridges, thats about it.

You people are lucky to be in a CJ7 ( I feel so ) and that too at such beautiful place. Forget about what are you doing there.

Actually that's an M170 ambulance Jeep, not a CJ-7.
