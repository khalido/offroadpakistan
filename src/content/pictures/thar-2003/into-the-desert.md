We're well into the desert now, way off the beaten track.

This looks like forbidding terrain.

Hi Sujo,
If u r particularly interested in the sand dune pictures u can visit a few more sites listed here.

dubaidesertclub.com
meoffroaders.com
dubai4x4.com

However its very difficult to figure out the desert terrain in the pictures due to similar colors of depressions and elevations. One could only see it properly with a naked eye only.

At offroadpakistan u'll find pictures of all types of terrain as Pakistan is blessed with mountains, deserts, rivers, sea....etc....u name it and its there. And I've seen one of the best variety and quality of pictures posted on this forum.
