Actually the Land Cruiser is not at fault, it seems its axles have touched the ground due to bad handling. Otherwise this is not a 4X4 which could really struck like that !!

This is not a very uncommon stuck in the desert. Doesnt matter which vehicle u drive in the desert u could get stuck. U learn the skills to drive in the desert with more experience but still if someone would say he/she has never got stuck in the desert then he/she has never been to the desert ;-)
