The roads were completely empty... so Abid decided to see how fast the Kia goes...

Damn, I didn't think these Kia's could go that fast!

Rev counter cannot be seen. But I am sure this is the last time ths perticullar jeep has touched 150

It actually hit 160 - and suprisingly enough, was just under the redline.

It can go fast there is no doubt, but if wheel comes off or it tire gets flat, the car or especially jeep can roll over many times.
So be careful.

Well, we got close to 170 km/h. And for an hour we averaged 120 km/h. Pretty fast for the KIA, though very taxing on the sound system - couldn't hear anything over the screaming engine. Now when I drive this car, its a challenge going above a 100 km/h, this engine seems to have had it. But we kinda convinced ourselves that its the sound of the so-called clutch fan.

And about wheels coming off, see this picture <http://offroadpakistan.com/pictures/chitral/major_breakdown.html> from an earlier trip from Karachi to Chitral in 1995. The axle pulled off the shaft while we were right behind. Fortunately there was a lull in traffic at that moment, and the driver, Taimur Mirza, expertly coasted the jeep to the side of the road (the right side).

Hello Abid,
Just wondering, did the engine wear out only by once running at 170 km/h or do you think it was a gradual wear out process. The odometer shows roughly 25K and I am seeking for your comment on Sportage's engine life and durability. Any update on engine's repairs, etc.
Thanks.

The odometer is now well over 40K, and the engine is still going strong. The noise Abid is talking about above was a slipping power steering fanbelt, which had to be replaced. The only work done to in the engine bay so far has been a few oil and filter changes. The engine seems quite durable - it has to be driven properly though. The short gearing combined with the low revs makes a lot of people not used to diesel engines ruin them very fast - but maintained and driven properly I think it will last well over a 100K. It is a mercedes engine after all.
