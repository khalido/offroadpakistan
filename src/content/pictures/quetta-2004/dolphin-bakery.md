![Dolphin Bakery](./F1000015.jpg)

MO standing at the counter of the Dolphin Bakery. This is the place to shop for food items in Quetta. Just about everything is here, and it's always been spotlessly clean. (the last 8 years at least since we've been going there).

A bit late to the party but I am pretty sure we did a lot of our food stuff shopping at the Dolphin Bakery in 2000 enroute to Khunjerab.
