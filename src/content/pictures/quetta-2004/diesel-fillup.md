A local filling station. They also give proper receipts and all. A police mobile was also filling up there. Irani diesel was at approx 8 Rs. as compared to Karachi prices of 25 Rs.

Nice Gas Station! Interesting :) two vehicles can be filled up at the same time until the jerrycan on the top is empty and need replacement with filled one, a cloth is used as fuel filer...nice.
