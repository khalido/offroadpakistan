A great personality, a great leader especialy for the people in Pakistan. If we see internationaly it was Allama Iqbal who think for the whole Muslim of the world. But Quiad-e-Azam think only for the Muslims living in Indopak. That's why Quiad-e-Azam is most important personality for people living in Pakistan. I love Quiad-e-Azam and to be try to some well for my country as well.

This is Sam from Soni Motors Thailand (www.sonimotorsthailand.com). Looks amazing.

I have an offsubject question. Is any of your member using Toyota Hilux Vigo. As you probably know we are Thailand's top Toyota Hilux Vigo exporter to Pakistan and very interested in profiling how some of our customers are using their Vigo for 4x4 adventuring

only a few nations have good leaders,who have woked with full devotion.so i request u all to pay full respect to him because he deserves it.i have heard some people using loose language for him.i request all such people to think before using such words for him.all such people should mind it that if we r breathing freely on this piece of land,it is all because of efforts and work fo this country.he is really a great leader.we all r united under the identity of being pakistani.
