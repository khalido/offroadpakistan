A view of the sea on the way to Hub. This is the only point on the highway where the sea is visible.

Picture is beautiful but it is disappointing to know that its the only part where sea is visible. What about Mekran Coastal Highway; is sea visible from many locations?

Yes, once you reach Aghor (Hingol River), you're driving right next to the sea. Beautiful views right along the highway, especially along the Buzi Pass.
