There are more people in this pickup truck than a typical New York subway train. Mind you, this is on the main highway to Quetta.

Mr Khalil jibran im also a musalman.but first im an indian,its my mother nation.tujhe woh musalman bhai lagega,but if thosa hangers are not musalmans what are they for u?so be a man first,then a believer.the holy quran teaches that and i think ur not ready to accept that.

apne sabhi pakisatani bhaiyon..... u can improve ur situation.come out from taboos and work to develop the nation.then ofcourse this wont be the picture taken after 10 yrs.
