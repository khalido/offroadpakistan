All your photographs brought back many pleasant memories. I used to attend St. Joseph's Convent High School in Quetta which was on Lytton Road across from the boys school St. Frances Grammar. I was a boarder there.

Hi, I went to St. Joseph's Convent from 1971 to 72. I was in Class three and four. I would like to hear from anyone who went to the same grades the same time. I remember names like Shama Nasir, Afsana Kazin, Zehnab Mari. The Class four teacher was Ms. Gloria, if I remeber correctly.

Hi, I went to St. Joseph's Convent in Quetta as well. I was there from 1991 till 1994; from Class three till six. I am looking for my friend Maimoona Kasi. The name of our teacher in class 6 was Ms. Andaleeb.

I went to St. Joseph's Convent School & Boarding (Quetta) between 1984-1987. Satrted from 1st standard. I only remember Ms. Pushpa Das and Ms. Laila Zubairi (Who has a daughter Tania) as they were teaching the junior school. Our house parent was Ms. Usha (salman's mom) & Sister Michel/Micael @ boarding. Then there was the daughter of our kitchen incharge Catherine, who was an attractive college going girl and used to live in the boarding with her mom as well. Then we had all jamali's & bazenjo's.... if someone can recall....???
