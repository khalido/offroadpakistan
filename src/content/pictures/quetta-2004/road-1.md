A picture of the highway. I've been told it violates the photographic law of two-thirds or some such thing, but here it is.

yes. the sign ought to have been a bit more to the center of frame. so we can see it better.

Center of frame? See it "better"? It IS pretty much in the center!

MO, you got some serious astigmatism going on there!

Either that or you meant the road should have been in the center...

Ahson, unless you are utterly blind, this signboard is NOT exactly in the center of the frame. Perhaps you need to get your eyeballs more firmly embedded in the center of your head.

Hey Cyclops, to regular old one-eye-on-each-side-of-the-nose me, it looks pretty much in the center of the frame.

New glasses with cylindrical correction for you maybe? ;-)
