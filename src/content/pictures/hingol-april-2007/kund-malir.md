This looked like a pioaessronfl crew that does music videos took this. I was all kinds of impressed and so happy to see the look on your two faces during this most important time. I couldn't travel down from Indiana to see it, so I was so happy to see it on facebook. It made me feel like I was sharing that special moment with you. God bless you both in your marriage and your future happiness.
