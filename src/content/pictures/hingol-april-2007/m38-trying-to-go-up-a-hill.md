It took a few attempts as there just wasn't any traction.

If this is sand then the key is to reduce pressure to 15psi on normal tires. On bigger ones even reduce it to 8-10 to get better results.

In many of places we go - the prob is that there are only a small patch/area of soft mud or sometimes sand - then there are dry streams with lot of boulders/stones - reduced air pressure in boulders means tyre would come off the rim. Our group is usually 6 to 10 or more vehicles so if somebody does get stuck, others are there to help out. Reducing tyre pressure of so many vehicles and then refilling again many times a day too big a hassle & time consuming!
