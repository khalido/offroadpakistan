look at the bueaty of nature,,,,,, people ask me wht the hell is fantasy there in the montains/rocks , ,,, but i dont know i feel
peace from my inner when i see this sort of place. May be we are attracted from nature because we are also part of it but lost in
material world(feelingless world).

WHY I GO OUT THERE - it's the "mitee" & "ghatta" ie the out doors! And the time spent with friends!!!!!

SMALL STORY - So we were out there on a dirt track - stopped at a small "chaiee" (tea) "chappar" (thatch roof) hotel middle of nowhere - an old guy asked why you here - said not for hunting, nor on a survey, nor to buy land, etc. We going to Khuzdar. So he says "don't you people know, there is a Pucca (metalled) road going to Khuzdar since last 50 years"!

Amazing Shot.
The Beauty is FORD.
Any other SUV which is common in Pakstan won't add deepness in the snap shot
