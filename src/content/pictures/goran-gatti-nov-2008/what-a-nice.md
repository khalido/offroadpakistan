OFCOURSE!!! It's the only one kind of 'machine' in Pakistan! It's a go anywhere vehicle - fun to drive! Lucky me - thanks to Sabiha who found it on a farm in California and after some two years got it to Karachi - it took another year to rebuilt it! NOT FOR SALE - for it is TOO good to be EVER SOLD!!!
