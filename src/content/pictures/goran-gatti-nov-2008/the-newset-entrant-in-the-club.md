Thanks!. Guess the 500 man hours i spent fixing the suspension seems to have paid off. Though now there is so much articulation i can almost still here the drivers side tire go 'khhhhhrrrrrrrrr' against the tire well :) Thinking am just gonna remove the fenders or something!

Articulation is good, and it's just a fender, a little bump now and than won't hurt it. I think a half inch or 3/4 inch spacer in the spring pack should fix the fender bumping issue up front.
