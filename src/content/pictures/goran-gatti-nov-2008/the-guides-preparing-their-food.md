The real guides were us, guided by GPS and Google Earth... We had about 4 locals with us altogether. We arrange before hand to have enough car space with us to fit all the guides. A couple of villagers from nearby had dropped in also to the campsite.

I know, but I found this one more/better accurate as compared to google earth that is OFF by miles sometimes.
