How many younger kids accompanied on this trip?? The young fellow on the jeep seems to be very happy and enjoying the hectic trip.

The young fellow probably enjoyed the trip the most! This time around there was just him, but back in March there were 5-6 kids under 10.

Hes a great chap, and its good to know that u guys take kids along. Many a times, in our offroading trips my son (now 11) is the only one to join. He accompanied me to the Liwa Desert (where the UAE Desert Challenge took place) for a pure offroad trip just a few weeks back.

When Khalid Omar was 8 yrs old (probably even younger) - he's been going on Jeep trips/camping! All kids should go - it's one of the very healthy activity possible!

I completely agree with you. Instead of taking kids to the malls and only for indoor games, v rather take them out for real life experiences. My kids go out with me all the time for offroading and camping and they love it.

My kids had their first camping outing when they were a few months old only and since then there has been no stop to it.

Seems like an awesome trip. How many jeeps ran on petrol or was it all diesel power ?
