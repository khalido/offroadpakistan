Complete with bedding and lights. While everyone else struggled to put up their tents Martin enjoyed a nice cup of tea.

I enjoyed your article & photo gallery on the taftan trip.
I would like to know if the roof top tents are available for sale in pakistan and if you could give me the contact for
buying one for my Land cruiser.
I will be truly grateful.
best regards
