Khalid and team - thanks for these photos as a great reminder of the time we had with you 4x4 nutters in Pakistan!! The trip through Balochistan was excellent fun and we feel honoured at the time and effort everyone put in to make it so special. We have made some great friends during our stay in Pakistan and hope to return one day for another adventure. Thanks for everything. Maz, Alex & Martin
