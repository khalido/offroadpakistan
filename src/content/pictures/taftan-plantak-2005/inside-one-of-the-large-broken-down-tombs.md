Beautiful snap. Are these ruins preserved? Has anything been done to ascertain their origin? These ruins and others you have shown on your ventures are great tourist attractions and therefore income for the country, also raising the livelihood of people around the area. These abandoned sites must have supported life, some earlier civilisation.

These ruins are pretty much left to their own devices, ever since the original makers disappeared. There are a number of other ruins in Pakistan, including Mohenjadora, which is possibly the oldest civilization on record.
