Very cool snap...especially like the 5 legged monster looking whatchamacallit in the middle

Yaar, I think this is the way how ancient people got around thousands of years ago, In other words, their way of offroading. ON the 4x4 Goats.

Thank you for the plug in, I downloaded the newer vreison and tried it on my upgraded WP.2.0.6 (which I thought was the latest) and it doesn't seem to work propertly. I get the following error:Fatal error: Call to undefined function: stripos() in /mnt/w0600/d28/s04/a000pzyk/www/ethan/nfblog/wp-content/plugins/post-levels.php on line 177Any idea what I am doing wrong? Also I had the previous vreison of the post levels which did not give me that error but was hiding my archived dates which is why I upgraded the post Level plugin, any suggestions? thank you for your time and hard work
