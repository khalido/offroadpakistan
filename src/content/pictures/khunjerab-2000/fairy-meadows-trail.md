Well you'll be glad to know it's been washed away by rains and a landslide so no future travelers will have to walk it.

.......But then someone said on the radio water bottles were behind the next big stones ....just few yards ahead of us...while we searched each stone, each corner every stump of tree......we were down right exhausted , blurry eyes, panting, gasping for air...decided there and then "I quit smoking"
but there was no water to be found. One just had to keep going.Will never forget this trail.
