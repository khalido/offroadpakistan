Isnt this shot from Gulmit along the KKH? I could swear this is from that hotel's balcony right on the bank of the Indus with the KKH just on the left of this picture.

I'm not sure of the exact place where this picture was taken, but Gulmit is on the left bank of the Indus going North. The Cathedral peaks visible in the distance are before Gulmit, so I dont't think its Gulmit.

It is a beautiful shot. You are invited to also see the photo I took from above Husaini while going on a trek to Gulmit glacier in July 2001.

This picture has been taken at Hussaini , Gojal.... the location probably is the ascending KKH after the four or five small bridges
