Where was this picture taken. I took a picture at exactly the same spot about 10 years ago, but can't remember if it was in Ghizr or further along in Yasin. We only spent a night at the rest house and then drove back to Chitral via Shandur, but the name if the village has completely slipped me. The color of the river was stunning.

This is somewhere in between the 1st and 7th heavenly place! So we also cannot exactly tell you where it is.

From this view I guess this is Phundar (Fundar) , 5-6 hours from Gilgit (depending upon your speed)

@MB, I think u r right. I visited this area some 20 years back and this seems to be the Phander lake area that falls between Teru and Yasin valley.
