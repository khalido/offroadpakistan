Hi
This is Rashid Again I and my family visited the area of Khanjrab back in the 2001 June. And I Believe we had encountered the similar land slide in seemingly the same spot. I guess this spot is hot for landslides.

hi.
Its pleasure to see the pics of your adventure through my area. I saw the pics and am comenting about this picture specially because its been very long since the kkh was built but this slide area is always been a problem for the traders as well as the tourist. who visit the area.
Any how great work out......Wish you best of luck
