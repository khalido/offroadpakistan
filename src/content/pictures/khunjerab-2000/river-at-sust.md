I doubt ANYONE would even attempt to go down this thing in a boat. Considering the slope down which the water is cascading, it would be safe to assume this is a waterfall. A boat wouldn't last 10 ft on those rocks and man, would it hurt!!

this is a site in my village, Gulmit. It is called the Skordh Dhour (The terrain of bridge). In the summers me along with my friends would go here and sit at the side of the stream. The violent cascading sprays dews everywhere, making you blithe with the sense of the wet air.
