The Americans think they have the best of the best, in terms of everything (land and people), but they obviously have missed Pakistan. MashAllah, Pakistan is by far the best Nation in the World. Both its land and people.

I lived most of my life in America and visited many places, but never seen anything close to what we have in our homeland of Pakistan. We need to appreciate and take care of our motherland and its people the best way possible. The God Almighty has blessed us with such beutiful country and the people are also one of the most hospitable and courteous. Pakistan Zindabad. May Allah bless our nation even more. Ameen

i wana say one thing to people of hunza that dont forget your own nature, culture, language and the most importent thing (for students) is, dont forget your objective to be in cities you have to set one thing in your mind that you have to
return to hunza one day and there must be postive change in you when you go back to hunza so that this postive change will bring happiness in your families and in people of hunza. thanks.
love you hunza.

**Iliri** - April 18, 2007  2:31 PM

The story of Hunza people is very interesting. Read this. "I became a friend of the Church's Council and after some days one of the church advisors called ç©«o phones me to let me know about their difficult position. During the conversation he told me that he found that I was interested about the history of Albanians and he wanted to show me what his father or his grandfather had told him. He told to me that his father had graduated at the Cairo University and as a student he went for a walk together with an Albanian student. A student of another nationaliy joined them too, their friend. While, they were walking they spoke in Arabic language. When they had to talk about something that was secret they spoke in Albanian in order not to be understood by their friend. Their friend kept quiet and when they finished the conversation he told them that he understood everything, and that he speaks that language too. Two Albanian students remained amazed and asked him why he didn't tell what he had studied Albanian language. He swore that he had never studied Albanian, but that language was spoken in his birthplace. They told him how could be spoken the Albanian language there; that he came from the cursed devil in Pakistan near India. He esplained them that his country was called Burria(men)(Burushu) and surely all of them were burria (men-soldiers) of Alexander the Great. The two Albanian stubborn students didn't believe to him. The boy became nervous becouse they called him a liar. He wrote to hsi father that when he will buy him the ticket for sumemr holidays he wanted to take two of his friends from the university who were speaking Albanian language. So, two Albanians went on summer holydays together with their friend in the place called Burria and when they arrived there they remaned senseles when they realized that they were speaking Albanian Langauge(surely in dialect). The boy's father since he was the Governor of Burria accepted them with a lot of pleasure and explained to them many interesting things and told to them that beyong the monuntains on the Indian part live our people in a place calles Kaushet(Qaushet).
I think that they didn't settle there after the murder of Achilles(Cleats), but they remained there when Alexander the Great decided to come back from India to Babylon and older soldiers who were Phillip's soldiers, bedore leaving he asked them to go through Hindu Kush, an easier way for older people. Whereas he left himself, Petale, India, through the desert of Makran, a very difficult and dangerous road. Whereas half of the army leaded by Narkos was aksed by him to go through the Indian Ocean, thinking that he will be connected with Nile and will come out in the Mediterranean Sea. I think that those who were sent through Hindi Kush about six thousand soldiers stopped in actual Burria. But, it is not sure yet becouse Alexander in order to protect the rear of the supplies he left many of his soldiers as in Baktria and in any other fortress. Burushu could be any of those soldiers

**Adeel** - November  4, 2008 11:15 AM

Well I've been going to Pakistan's northern areas since I was a child. That developed the love for nature which probably is transferred to my children as well. I've been traveling in Pakistan's north on all means of travel including foot, offroad, car, motorbike, bus etc.etc. Though I've not traveled in Pak for the last decade or so but have done extensive travel outside Pak including UK, Canada, USA etc. etc. But I will vote Pakistan as the most beautiful country having all sorts of terrain.
Hunza valley becomes more beautiful if you hike around it. You get precious views from Ultar glacier and Ultar top.
