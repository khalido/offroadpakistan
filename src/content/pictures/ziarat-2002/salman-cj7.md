Fun drive to Chauthair Tangi. Finally got to flick that lever to 4-low and do some real 'wheeling. This turn was pretty tricky - these two boulders pinched the apex of a tight turn and the over hang of the CJ's bulky front end made it difficult to judge exactly how close we could get without getting massaged by the rock

Salman, The person who built this CJ7 originally, Fakhri, passed away recently, he was a good friend and a shikari, loved Jeeps and over the years had re-built a number of good vehicles, please recite sura-e-fateha for the departed soul.
