There are only two Jeeps in this picture - one at either end. The rest are all wannabe 4x4s!!!! :P

Great Website, love off roading, I used to live in Massacheusetts where I had a pick up, loved it. Im hoping to move back to India, and hopefully with better political conditions bring across a few Scorpios and Safaris and hit the trails with the CJ'S and Landcruisers

Thanks, It's been 10 years since I left
Pakistan. I grew up in Quetta, and have been to Ziarat numerous times. These pictures bring back a lot of memories. Maybe someday when I'll move back to Pakistan, I might join your club. Michigan U.S

May I suggest the Sulaiman Range as a possible future excursion, mainly because I want to see the pics of what that area looks like ;)
