You did an awesome job. Our website is www.fordtruckclub.com. My truck is the green 1949 pickup. I also work for a company that sells truck parts www.pros-pick.com. You could also check out that as well. - Great job - the truck looks really good.

One of the sweetest '48 rebuilds I've ever seen, that's for sure. Bet those handles at the top edges of the bed come in handy!
