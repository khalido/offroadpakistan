WisdomIsMisery's maturity is rlivaed only by his immaturity. As a Scorpio, many women wish death on him and some have attempted to hasten its arrival. He purposefully antagonizes people and lives on the Internet because real life doesn't have a block feature. He is not a model, a model citizen or a role model. If it wasn't for social media he'd be a sociopath. You should read his posts because if you read this bio you obviously have nothing better to do.
