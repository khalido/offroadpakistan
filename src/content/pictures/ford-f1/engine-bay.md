I'm surprised there isn't a centrifugal air pre-cleaner on this truck. They are very common for diesel engines - especially when turbo-charged. In dusty conditions they will save your truck from choking on a clogged air-filter, and prevent having to try to clean an air filter in the middle of a dust storm. Just a thought...

Well if you are talking about the Red Ford F1 truck - it rides high so some dust is avoided - inside the bonnet it has a centrifuge filter + a super large sized oil bath filter - most of the other vehicles needed their air (paper) filters cleaned every morning - the Red truck could have gone in same area for another week or more before it would have needed cleaning!!
