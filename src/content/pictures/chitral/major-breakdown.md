Though it might seem the tyre is taking a rest by the side of the jeep, this was a major breakdown on our first day out of Karachi, three hours short of Sukkur.

Major breakdown! That doesn't come close. I was sitting in there with my two "little" kids! Thank you guardian angel.

This was our first adventure. It took at least 8 hours to get fixed!!
