Another view of the river. This picture doesn't do it justice. The lake is at the end of the swat valley, about three hours beyond Kalam.

sir i would like to clarify the name if this lake is MAHU DHAND...its 3 kms north or kalam!! and indeed it is very beautiful as ive gone there more than 20 times......if u want to see a place more beautiful than this one go to KUMRAAT valley in the dir district...it is 10 times more beautiful and the beauty of it is that it is still a virgin valley.....u can say i grew up in the whole of the northern areas as my father was the head so i know these places like the back of my hand and if u need more info abt other beautiful places i wd gladly help

**Dr Zaheer Sattar** - June 27, 2005  1:44 PM

I visited this lake in 1990, i was 17 then. its route was wild and genuine jungle ride then...........the lake itself is actually a zigzagging network of blue streams.........we were the only visitors there that day.............upper swat at its best..........Mahodand's draems have never left my sleep eversince..... i was a beginner photographer then.....i couldn't capture it the rightway........now i am a semi pro.....i will do much better now.

The photographer of the above image says it rrrrrrrrright........it doesn't do justice to the actual lake.

Now a days i hear its been polluted by khokha hotels and rubbish stuff.....a lot of jeeps go there daily..........and pollute it even more...........the typical pakistani side effect of development.....

If any one wants the scene as it is in the photo (actually it is much more), the best time to go there is before july 15.....after that the ground levelling blue zigzags are no more.........water starts receding.

go there if u can........and tell whats left........

i visited this lake in 2005, in july.This lake is at the end of SWAT valley, and then u can goto chitral which will take you 2 days by walk as there r no roads OR tracks. This lake is a start of swat river, and is very beautiful place.The only thing i didnt liked abt it is, the polution there! which is caused by the tourist etc.My request to u all " visit this place but please dont ruin it".
A perfect place to visit! luv pakistan~!

Just came back from Mahudand lake, it is a beautiful place capable of having rock climbing resort in Pakistan. The terrain is full of amazing rocks, gushing cold waters and lots of adventure. Really like this place and never forget the log bridge underwhich cold water is rushing down. Nature is amazing.

I visited this place on July-19-2007 and its really a good place i wish to go there again when there will be peace. Due to STUPID MUSHARRAF policies this area become hell for visitors otherwise this place is a heaven. There is another lake SAIFULLAH just 2 or 3 KM from Mahodhand also visit that place its more beautiful then Mahodhand

GOD BLESS PAKISTAN

**Waseem Ahmed Kausar** - April 16, 2008  4:28 PM

Its very beautiful lake and I visited three times. Twice on a 4X4 jeep and once on my own motorbike. It taken 2 hrs. and 30 minutes to reach on motor bike. it was amazing trip. We have a little group to bike riders and we often go to such places like Kaghan Naran, Swat, Chitral and Gilgit also. So i can say that the roads of northern areas are on my finger tips. Any one can take guidance while going to arrange a trip. My cell no. is 0300-9561511

**Nadeem** - June 29, 2008 12:32 PM

I wonder why is it called a LAKE, where as it is a RIVER

I went there twice in 2005. I was depressed to see Swat, which unlike it's reputation is not beautiful or green (even Islamababd's Margallah mountains are more green), the area ahead of Swat is somewhat better but nothing worth mentioning, five hours of drive ahead of Swat takes u to Kalam. Kalam and areas are are beautiful, serene and green. I was impressed by the two hour drive and the land/area falling on the way and Maudand River's beauty. It is not a lake, but a river jutting out of the glacier ahead of Maudand and then going all acorss Swat to reach Nowshera etc

**asfandyar** - July 26, 2008  9:09 PM

Well, to be realy honest, i must say this picture fails to explain the real beauty of Mahodand. The place is for most beautifull then it looks. Those who have been there will agree with me. But But But....... There is no question regarding the beauty of that place. Its beautiful. Its paradise on earth.
