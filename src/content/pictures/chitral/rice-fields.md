@Abdur Rahim, I've been to Bunni (the first establishment after Shandur towards Gilgit) and I love that place. I camped at the rest house old building in 1992 during our bike (one yamaha 100 and two people) expedition in the north. Cant forget it.

My apologies for the previous comment as I mixed up Bunni with Teru. Bunni falls on the Chitral side.
