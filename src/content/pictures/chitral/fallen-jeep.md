![Fallen Jeep](./chitral_omars_25.jpg)

This local jeep had gone into the river just a few minutes before we got there. The driver managed to jump out as the jeep went down and came out scratchless. Dr. Mansur orchestrated the rescue attempt, while Hamid Omar and Taimur Mirza were the brains behind actually bringing it up.
