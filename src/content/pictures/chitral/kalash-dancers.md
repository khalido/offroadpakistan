Dear Webmaster,

I hope you both are absolutely fine.

I was watching your page about Kalash valley and I am very happy to see that you visited that valley and subscribed the details about that valley and their people on internet.

I am also from Pakistan and I am very happy to see that page. You people have displayed very beautiful pictures on the page. It is a wonderful work.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

Farhan.

Hi Taj,

How are you? Good to hear from you. We have not forgotten you at all.

Infact, friend of mine and her husband are planning a trip to the
Northern Areas, I have suggested to them to visit Chitral. I will pass
on your email address to them so that they can coordinate their plans
with you if they finalise their trip.

I myself am quite interested in visitng Chitral and this time I plan
to make it a trekking trip. How are things with you? Are you in
Peshawar nowadays?

Regards

**alybhai** - August  2, 2006 11:11 AM

You have been or you plan to visit the Kalash Valleys. But keep this in mind, you won't find a pristine culture preserved from the rest of the world, a sort of Shangri-La but a 'Touristan" massivelly invaded not only by tourists, who are often irresponsible, but by their/our ideas. What is left of the Kalash culture are the ladies colorful dresses. I could say more but...it wouldn't really be appropriate.

**Ijaz Ahmad** - June 12, 2008  4:01 PM

This is wounderful to see so many people through their own comments. I'm a sports journalist working with Associated Press and I have so much interaction with the people around the world besides in touch with the people of chitral by covering all sports events including Polo and one of my polo story, Polo at roof top, also got prize as well. So if any one regarding such affairs can contact me on my e-mail: shanankhan@yahoo.com, shanankhan@hotmail.com

S Nazar Fatimi Chitral
Immenece POTENTIALS of Chitral and NA
I found it among the most constructive web pages. Go on with ur creative and positive developments, and share it with others.
We have immence resources, Beauty areas, unique culture, thrilling exploring cites, mineral resources, tourism industry potentials,
unexplored trotting points, wild life rare species, water hydal and immence potentials of flora and fauna. Govertment is unaware and un interested exploring these resources. NGO's are also making ahead unfolding these sources and resources.

It is said about the NGO's (not all) that, their deeds are NOBLE, their DESIGNS are EVILS and their PLANNERS r devils. Why not they FOCUS and explore the sustainable rources of developments to change the lot of the poor peoples of the area.Pl share ideas.
