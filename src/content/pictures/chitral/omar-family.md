Being a photographer i can only comment on the picture quality and missing elements of it. The problem of focus and over contrast look hard to identify the persons features but PICTURES ARE ALWAYS POSITIVE, EVEN IF YOU DONT LOOK AT THEIR NEGATIVES.
Picture also reveals that Pakistan beautiful, no-matter how you photograph it.
Thanks for Omar family to share their light moments.
May Allah bless them all.
