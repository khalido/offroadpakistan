I was always curious of exploraring Hub Dam but never got a chance to visit it when I was in Karachi. On a spring sunday in London I just typed hub dam on a serach engine and found these wonderful pictures!.

All is there but where is the dam,where is the spillway,why there is no photo of any wild life of the dam..no fish or fisherman is included. staff,guards,security, enterance are not included. you have provided good looks of the dam but the points I pointed out may be considered in future.thanks.

Ghori,

This is a travel website, not an online resource for terrorists and saboteurs, that they shd put up pics of entrances, spillways and security. There is ample security at the dam, and the guards at the Dam will look well after you. There is a government rest house there up on a hill for people who have forgotten their way. They are well looked after until they have found their way. The ones that leave prematurely add to the biodiversity of the aquatic life in the dam. Hope this helps.

Fareed sb! its a game reserve and hunting is prohibited their. I believe Wild life department must issue limited permits for hunting in the century because over population is also not healthy. However, our bad luck "permit say ziada sources ki zaroorat hai"
