Hi
Excellent website, I have often looked at places on the map and thought, what does this area look like, and thanks to your travel pics got to find out about a few places.
Incidently, were you aware that there are supposed to be mugger crocodiles in the Hub dam and swimming was not advisable there in the past!

The crocodiles are still supposedly there, but there aren't many left now.
