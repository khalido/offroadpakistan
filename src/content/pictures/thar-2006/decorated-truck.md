It has taken me a little while to fiugre out how this camera works the best. I have been taking pictures of the flying squirrels who come into my yard to feed at my bird feeders. So far pictures are OK, but not super, although my subjects are pretty small. I have the camera about 10 feet from the tree. I have yet to try this on deer. Batteries holding up real well, and downloading pictures is a snap. Programming is easy and camera seems pretty rugged. I could have paid 50-75 more for additional features and more pixels, but this will probably meet my needs.
