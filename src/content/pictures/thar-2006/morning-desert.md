I THANK YOU ALL FOR THE THAR DESERT PICTURES AND VIDEO. THIS REMINDS ME OF THE 1971 WAR THAT I FOUGHT AGAINST INDIA. I WAS A YOUNG MAN AND WAS PROUD TO FIGHT ALONG SIDE THE
HUR MUJAHIDS AND THE RAJARS.I WAS SPECIALY FIGHTING THIS PART OF THE DESERT ABOUT A IOO MILES FROM HATHUNGO. I LIVE IN USA NOW AND THESE PICTURES BROUGHT MY MEMORIES BACK.
THANK YOU ALL AND MAY ALLAH BLESS PAKISTAN AND BRING PEACE TO OUR COUNTRY.
