Vintage 1951, this jeep can still put its younger successors to shame. The most powerful jeep crossed it with absolutely no trouble!

Excellent photos I must say. Also, the concept of travelling through Pakistan by road is fascinating. I also love to travel and have gone twice to Murree and back in my Suzuki Mehran!!!! Well, I travelled with my son and wife and it was fun. We started from Karachi making stop-overs at Hyderabad, Sukkur, daharki, Sadiqabad, Multan, Lahore, Islamabad and finally at Murree.
