Hello Frances Kalmer,Thank you for your note. The dancing bunny paiitnng sold but I can paint another paiitnng with changes that work for you. Most paiitnngs you see are sold. I paint commission work all the time. The originals sell for $2.00 per square inch. I would be happy to repaint ( I always put in a few changes to make it yours) that paiitnng for you. Thanks again for your interest and let me know if i can paint anything just for you. Lynn Bredeson
