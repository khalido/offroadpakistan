just a thought but if you want it to be a pvp type of game how about mkaing it about the banapple war, it dont have to be pvp if you dont want hell its you and tylors game so you get to shoot down all the suggestions that you want and no one can B**** about it, but yea if you are mkaing an rpg/mmorpg type game i have ideas for a completely different game and they mostly consist of dragons.
