A cow had fallen down the mountainside - the villagers rushed down and salvaged its meat. The children are carrying part of the cow back to their homes.

Savefiles in \PlantsVsZombies\userdata are not the one used when running on Vista. Had anoyne found the real place where savefiles are stored on Vista? I have searched the computer for files with same name as the one in the userdata-library but could not find any. Could the files have another name???
