I am the Chief Engineer for the reconstruction of the new Government Degree College shown in the far left background of the picture (RCC columns). We belong to the Japan International Cooperation System (JICS) and would like to correct that the tents shown in the
foreground was then a military installation of the Pak Army Engineering Battalion. To date, reconstruction of the new Government Degree College
as well as a new Bridge and Access Road up to KKH had been completed and due to be inaugurated on October 8, 2009.
