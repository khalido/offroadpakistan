I seriously would like it if you had this inorfmation and a few of your different blogposts in a online video format, do you create many video tutorials? I am really one of the select few who grasp a lot more material from observing things in action and I would definitely appreciate it if you are able to present your stuff that way. I like a lot of your topics and it really shows that you put a little thought into them. It's nice to finally explore a blog that the author cares about. Would you care if I include a little of your material on my site so long as I give you the credit? I feel a number of your reports and posts could go well with our stuff, especially this one. Fantastic stuff there. I'll just make a note of this post in case you can't find time to get back to me.
