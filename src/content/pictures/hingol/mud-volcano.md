There are two large active mud volcanoes on the coast of Balochistan. The higher one being 450 feet and the other about 250 with a large crater housing a small pond of bubbling water. These volcanoes have a special position in the Hindu religion and are called "Chandra Gups". Devotees travelling to the temple of Hinglaj stop here and make offerings of coconuts and other rituals. The temple of Hinglaj is further along the coast about 100 kilometers. Amongst numerous these two are the largest and highest mud volcanoes in the region.

Mssg for Arun Naik,
Hi My name is Azhar and I am frequent visiter to this area of Hinglaj's mandir. The annaul pilgrimage is some time in March. I will find out for yu the exact date as I will go there next week.
You will have to come to Karachi and then go to Uthal a small town in Baluchistan province which is About three hours drive. This is where the yatra starts. People go by Cars, jeeps, Bikes even on foot.
If yu go by car or jeep it will take yu one and a Half hour to chadarkoop and another one hour to Hinglaj.
I will leave a mssg for yu here about the exact dates. Try searchig Nani mandir and Nani hinglaj as ther are at least two web sites posted about this pilgrimage. They might be able to help yu also about yr arrangements.
Azhar

Dear Sushmita,

Thanks for ur interest. I dontv think the trip to Hinglaj will be very expensive, especially not if u go with one of the many groups of local Hindu pilgrims. I have some Hindu friends in Karachi, and if u like I can find out the cost of such a trip for u.

Regards,

Salman Ali
